##How to be more productive on Project Euler 101

For the first 12 Project Euler problems my average problem resolution rate was 2 hours per problem using C++. I consider this ineffective since the difficulty level for these problems is 5%. 

###The basic tools needed for resolving a problem are:

- Being logged in to check if your solution is correct at:
https://projecteuler.net/sign_in

- The problem itself, found at:
https://projecteuler.net/problem=problem_number_here
(Maybe a local databse/file of all project euler problems would also help here)

- Admitting you're pushing your work to github:
A machine that can both compile your program and push your work directly to github from the command-line rather than via github.com

git clone https://github.com/username/reponame.git

cd reponame

git add -A

git commit -m "your comment on this commit here"

git push

- A start template for your file
