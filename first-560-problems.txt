The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So
the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten
terms would be:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
     Ã‚Â 1: 1
     Ã‚Â 3: 1,3
     Ã‚Â 6: 1,2,3,6
     10: 1,2,5,10
     15: 1,3,5,15
     21: 1,3,7,21
     28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
n Ã¢Â†Â’ n/2 (n is even)
n Ã¢Â†Â’ 3n + 1 (n is odd)
Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
13 Ã¢Â†Â’ 40 Ã¢Â†Â’ 20 Ã¢Â†Â’ 10 Ã¢Â†Â’ 5 Ã¢Â†Â’ 16 Ã¢Â†Â’ 8 Ã¢Â†Â’ 4 Ã¢Â†Â’ 2 Ã¢Â†Â’ 1
It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains
10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought
that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n
which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a Ã¢Â‰Â  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and
each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55
and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and

A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is
exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28
would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n
and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest
number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By
mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can
be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot
be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest
number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than
this limit.

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values
n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible
by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41Ã‚Â² + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.
The incredible formula Ã‚Â nÃ‚Â² Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80
primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the coefficients,

The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of
each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting
sub-string divisibility property.
Let d1 be the 1st digit, d2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note
the following:
    * d2d3d4=406 is divisible by 2
    * d3d4d5=063 is divisible by 3
    * d4d5d6=635 is divisible by 5

**** Problem 54 ****

rating: 10%
In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from
lowest to highest, in the following way:
    * High Card: Highest value card.
    * One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
    * Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
    * Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
    * Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
    * Flush: All cards of the same suit.
    * Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
    * Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
    * Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
    * Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.
The cards are valued in the order:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest
value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1
below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens,
then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the
highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.
Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:
Hand Ã‚ÂPlayer 1          Ã‚ÂPlayer 2            Ã‚ÂWinner
1    Ã‚Â5H 5C 6S 7S KD    Ã‚Â2C 3S 8S 8D TD      Ã‚ÂPlayer 2

***** Lychrel numbers *****

Published on Friday, 24th October 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 36601; Difficulty
rating: 5%
If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
349 + 943 = 1292,
1292 + 2921 = 4213
4213 + 3124 = 7337
That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196,
never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the
reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical
nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume
that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that
for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in
less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that
exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the
first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a
palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).
Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel
numbers; the first example is 4994.
How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?
NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the

infinite continued fraction.
Ã¢ÂˆÂš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...
By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...
The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth

***** XOR decryption *****
**** Problem 59 ****
Published on Friday, 19th December 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 28465; Difficulty
rating: 5%
Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred
standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For
example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.
A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII,
then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage
with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text,
restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.
For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text
message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the
encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without
both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.
Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified
method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the
message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the
message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key
for security, but short enough to be memorable.
Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower
case characters. Using cipher.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a
file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain
text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of
the ASCII values in the original text.

***** Convergents of e *****
**** Problem 65 ****
Published on Friday, 12th March 2004, 06:00 pm; Solved by 20288; Difficulty
rating: 15%
The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.
Ã¢ÂˆÂš2 = 11+
Ã‚Â        2 + 1
Ã‚Â        Ã‚Â 2 + 1
Ã‚Â        Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 2 + 1
Ã‚Â        Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 2 + ...
The infinite continued fraction can be written, Ã¢ÂˆÂš2 = [1;(2)], (2) indicates
that 2 repeats ad infinitum. In a similar way, Ã¢ÂˆÂš23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)].
It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for
square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the
convergents for Ã¢ÂˆÂš2.
1 + 1 = 3/2
Ã‚Â 2 Ã‚Â 
1 + 1     = 7/5
Ã‚Â 2 + 1
Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 2 Ã‚Â 
1 + 1         = 17/12
Ã‚Â 2 + 1     Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 2 + 1 Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 2 Ã‚Â 
1 + 1             = 41/29
Ã‚Â 2 + 1
Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 2 + 1     Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 2 + 1 Ã‚Â 
Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 2 Ã‚Â 
Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for Ã¢ÂˆÂš2 are:
1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70, 239/169, 577/408, 1393/985, 3363/2378, ...
What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,
e = [2; 1,2,1, 1,4,1, 1,6,1 , ... , 1,2k,1, ...].
The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:
2, 3, 8/3, 11/4, 19/7, 87/32, 106/39, 193/71, 1264/465, 1457/536, ...
The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10th convergent is 1+4+5+7=17.

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
x2 Ã¢Â€Â“ Dy2 = 1
For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 Ã¢Â€Â“ 13ÃƒÂ—1802 = 1.
It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is
square.
By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the
following:
32 Ã¢Â€Â“ 2ÃƒÂ—22 = 1
22 Ã¢Â€Â“ 3ÃƒÂ—12 = 1

Working clockwise, and starting from the group of three with the numerically
lowest external node (4,3,2 in this example), each solution can be described
uniquely. For example, the above solution can be described by the set: 4,3,2;
6,2,1; 5,1,3.
It is possible to complete the ring with four different totals: 9, 10, 11, and

Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of

A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice to
determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction. Without
any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability:
2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH

In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player
to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do
not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to
jail.
At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player
lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and,
after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile.
There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we
are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not
concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH
square.
    * Community Chest (2/16 cards):
         1. Advance to GO
         2. Go to JAIL
    * Chance (10/16 cards):
         1. Advance to GO
         2. Go to JAIL
         3. Go to C1
         4. Go to E3
         5. Go to H2
         6. Go to R1
         7. Go to next R (railway company)
         8. Go to next R
         9. Go to next U (utility company)
        10. Go back 3 squares.
The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular
square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For
this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the
probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest
probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final
square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We
shall make no distinction between "Just Visiting" and being sent to JAIL, and
we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to "get out of jail",
assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.
By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can
concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with
sets of squares.
Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order,
are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square
00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal
string: 102400.
If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-
digit modal string.

A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by 3, and a
fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces of the room
the shortest "straight line" distance from S to F is 10 and the path is shown
on the diagram.

However, there are up to three "shortest" path candidates for any given cuboid
and the shortest route doesn't always have integer length.
It can be shown that there are exactly 2060 distinct cuboids, ignoring
rotations, with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of M by M by M, for
which the shortest route has integer length when M = 100. This is the least

A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set
of at least two natural numbers, {a1, a2, ... , ak} is called a product-sum
number: N = a1 + a2 + ... + ak = a1 ÃƒÂ— a2 ÃƒÂ— ... ÃƒÂ— ak.
For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 ÃƒÂ— 2 ÃƒÂ— 3.
For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this property a
minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, k
= 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.
k=2: 4 = 2 ÃƒÂ— 2 = 2 + 2
k=3: 6 = 1 ÃƒÂ— 2 ÃƒÂ— 3 = 1 + 2 + 3
k=4: 8 = 1 ÃƒÂ— 1 ÃƒÂ— 2 ÃƒÂ— 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4
k=5: 8 = 1 ÃƒÂ— 1 ÃƒÂ— 2 ÃƒÂ— 2 ÃƒÂ— 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2
k=6: 12 = 1 ÃƒÂ— 1 ÃƒÂ— 1 ÃƒÂ— 1 ÃƒÂ— 2 ÃƒÂ— 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6
Hence for 2Ã¢Â‰Â¤kÃ¢Â‰Â¤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12
= 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.
In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2Ã¢Â‰Â¤kÃ¢Â‰Â¤12 is
{4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.
What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2Ã¢Â‰Â¤kÃ¢Â‰Â¤12000?

For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are basic
rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some numbers to be
expressed in more than one way there is always a "best" way of writing a
particular number.
For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the
number sixteen:
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
VIIIIIIIIIII
VVIIIIII
XIIIIII
VVVI
XVI
However, according to the rules only XIIIIII and XVI are valid, and the last
example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of
numerals.

***** Cube digit pairs *****
**** Problem 90 ****
Published on Friday, 4th March 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 7232; Difficulty
rating: 40%
Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it;
the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in
different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.
For example, the square number 64 could be formed:

In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to
display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36,
49, 64, and 81.
For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on
one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.
However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so
that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for
all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to
obtain 09.
In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each
cube, not the order.
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in
the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} for the
purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.
How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the square
numbers to be displayed?

By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and
making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, Ã¢ÂˆÂ’, *, /) and brackets/
parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.
For example,
8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2
14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)
19 = 4 * (2 + 3) Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ 1
36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)
Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.
Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different
target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the numbers 1 to 28 can
be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.

The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number
itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As the
sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.
Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the
proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason,
220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.
Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with 12496, we
form a chain of five numbers:
12496 Ã¢Â†Â’ 14288 Ã¢Â†Â’ 15472 Ã¢Â†Â’ 14536 Ã¢Â†Â’ 14264 (Ã¢Â†Â’ 12496 Ã¢Â†Â’ ...)
Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.
Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element

who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin
Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks
(or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box
contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting
puzzle grid and its solution grid.

A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by
logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods in order
to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The
complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example
above is considered easy because it can be solved by straight forward direct
deduction.

***** Optimum polynomial *****

rating: 35%
If we are presented with the first k terms of a sequence it is impossible to
say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many
polynomial functions that can model the sequence.
As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by
the generating function,
un = n3: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ...
Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the
principle that "simple is best" we should assume a linear relationship and
predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7). Even if we were presented
with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic
relationship should be assumed.
We shall define OP(k, n) to be the nth term of the optimum polynomial
generating function for the first k terms of a sequence. It should be clear
that OP(k, n) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for n Ã¢Â‰Â¤ k,
and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be OP(k, k+1); in which
case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).
As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most
sensible to assume constancy; that is, for n Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 2, OP(1, n) = u1.
Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:
OP(1, n) = 1                     1, 1, 1, 1, ...
OP(2, n) = 7nÃ¢ÂˆÂ’6             1, 8, 15, ...
OP(3, n) = 6n2Ã¢ÂˆÂ’11n+6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 1, 8, 27, 58, ...
OP(4, n) = n3                    1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...
Clearly no BOPs exist for k Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 4.
By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in red above),
we obtain 1 + 15 + 58 = 74.
Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:
un = 1 Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ n + n2 Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ n3 + n4 Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ n5 + n6 Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ n7 + n8 Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ n9 + n10

Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a

   2. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
If S(A) is minimised for a given n, we shall call it an optimum special sum
set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.
n = 1: {1}
n = 2: {1, 2}
n = 3: {2, 3, 4}
n = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}
n = 5: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}
It seems that for a given optimum set, A = {a1, a2, ... , an}, the next optimum
set is of the form B = {b, a1+b, a2+b, ... ,an+b}, where b is the "middle"
element on the previous row.
By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for n = 6 to be A =
{11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24}, with S(A) = 117. However, this is not the optimum
set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a near optimum set. The
optimum set for n = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25}, with S(A) = 115 and

***** Special subset sums: meta-testing *****

Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a
special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the
following properties are true:
   1. S(B) Ã¢Â‰Â  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
   2. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly
increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.
Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a
set for which n = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality
(first rule). Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 out of the 966 subset pairs need
to be tested.
For n = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be
tested for equality?

***** Darts *****
**** Problem 109 ****
Published on Friday, 18th November 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 5329; Difficulty
rating: 45%
In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which is
split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.

The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the dart
lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The
black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the
red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores
respectively.
At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region,
or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double,
worth 50 points.
There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players
will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running
total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a "doubles out"
system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double
bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other
dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for
that set of three darts is "bust".
When a player is able to finish on their current score it is called a
"checkout" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and
double bull).
There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:
                                 ____________
                                |  |    |    |

                                |S2|S2__|D1__|
Note that D1 D2 is considered different to D2 D1 as they finish on different
doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the same as T1 S1 D1.
In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for
example, D3 is the same as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.
Incredibly there are 42336 distinct ways of checking out in total.
How many distinct ways can a player checkout with a score less than 100?

Considering 4-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that they
cannot all be the same: 1111 is divisible by 11, 2222 is divisible by 22, and
so on. But there are nine 4-digit primes containing three ones:
1117, 1151, 1171, 1181, 1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111
We shall say that M(n, d) represents the maximum number of repeated digits for
an n-digit prime where d is the repeated digit, N(n, d) represents the number
of such primes, and S(n, d) represents the sum of these primes.
So M(4, 1) = 3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit prime
where one is the repeated digit, there are N(4, 1) = 9 such primes, and the sum
of these primes is S(4, 1) = 22275. It turns out that for d = 0, it is only
possible to have M(4, 0) = 2 repeated digits, but there are N(4, 0) = 13 such
cases.
In the same way we obtain the following results for 4-digit primes.

The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring
3Ã‚Â xÃ‚Â 2Ã‚Â xÃ‚Â 1 is twenty-two.

If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes to
cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight cubes,
and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to cover
every visible face.
However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5Ã‚Â xÃ‚Â 1Ã‚Â xÃ‚Â 1 also requires
twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring 5Ã‚Â xÃ‚Â 3Ã‚Â xÃ‚Â 1,
7Ã‚Â xÃ‚Â 2Ã‚Â xÃ‚Â 1, and 11Ã‚Â xÃ‚Â 1Ã‚Â xÃ‚Â 1 all contain forty-six cubes.
We shall define C(n) to represent the number of cuboids that contain n cubes in
one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and C(118) = 8.
It turns out that 154 is the least value of n for which C(n) = 10.

The radical of n, rad(n), is the product of distinct prime factors of n. For
example, 504 = 23 ÃƒÂ— 32 ÃƒÂ— 7, so rad(504) = 2 ÃƒÂ— 3 ÃƒÂ— 7 = 42.
We shall define the triplet of positive integers (a, b, c) to be an abc-hit if:
   1. GCD(a, b) = GCD(a, c) = GCD(b, c) = 1
   2. a < b
   3. a + b = c
   4. rad(abc) < c
For example, (5, 27, 32) is an abc-hit, because:
   1. GCD(5, 27) = GCD(5, 32) = GCD(27, 32) = 1
   2. 5 < 27
   3. 5 + 27 = 32
   4. rad(4320) = 30 < 32
It turns out that abc-hits are quite rare and there are only thirty-one abc-

A hexagonal tile with number 1 is surrounded by a ring of six hexagonal tiles,
starting at "12 o'clock" and numbering the tiles 2 to 7 in an anti-clockwise
direction.
New rings are added in the same fashion, with the next rings being numbered 8
to 19, 20 to 37, 38 to 61, and so on. The diagram below shows the first three
rings.
By finding the difference between tile n and each of its six neighbours we
shall define PD(n) to be the number of those differences which are prime.
For example, working clockwise around tile 8 the differences are 12, 29, 11, 6,
1, and 13. So PD(8) = 3.
In the same way, the differences around tile 17 are 1, 17, 16, 1, 11, and 10,
hence PD(17) = 2.
It can be shown that the maximum value of PD(n) is 3.
If all of the tiles for which PD(n) = 3 are listed in ascending order to form a
sequence, the 10th tile would be 271.
Find the 2000th tile in this sequence.

Let ABC be a triangle with all interior angles being less than 120 degrees. Let

Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of X such that p + q + r was

Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles AOB, BNC and AMC are
constructed on each side of triangle ABC, the circumscribed circles of AOB,
BNC, and AMC will intersect at a single point, T, inside the triangle. Moreover
he proved that T, called the Torricelli/Fermat point, minimises p + q + r. Even
more remarkable, it can be shown that when the sum is minimised, AN = BM = CO =
p + q + r and that AN, BM and CO also intersect at T.
If the sum is minimised and a, b, c, p, q and r are all positive integers we

In laser physics, a "white cell" is a mirror system that acts as a delay line
for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on the mirrors,
and eventually works its way back out.
The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the equation
4x2 + y2 = 100
The section corresponding to Ã¢ÂˆÂ’0.01 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ x Ã¢Â‰Â¤ +0.01 at the top is missing,
allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.
The light beam in this problem starts at the point (0.0,10.1) just outside the
white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at (1.4,-9.6).
Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the usual
law of reflection "angle of incidence equals angle of reflection." That is,
both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with the normal line
at the point of incidence.
In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of contact
between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue line shows the
line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of the first bounce.
The slope m of the tangent line at any point (x,y) of the given ellipse is: m =
Ã¢ÂˆÂ’4x/y
The normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of
incidence.
The animation on the right shows the first 10 reflections of the beam.

rating: 50%
A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires a
sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.
Every Monday morning, the foreman opens a new envelope, containing a large
sheet of the special paper with size A1.
He proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then he cuts
one of them in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until he obtains the
A5-size sheet needed for the first batch of the week.
All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.
At the beginning of each subsequent batch, he takes from the envelope one sheet
of paper at random. If it is of size A5, he uses it. If it is larger, he
repeats the 'cut-in-half' procedure until he has what he needs and any
remaining sheets are always placed back in the envelope.
Excluding the first and last batch of the week, find the expected number of
times (during each week) that the foreman finds a single sheet of paper in the
envelope.
Give your answer rounded to six decimal places using the format x.xxxxxxÃ‚Â .

rating: 65%
As we all know the equation x2=-1 has no solutions for real x.
If we however introduce the imaginary number i this equation has two solutions:
x=i and x=-i.
If we go a step further the equation (x-3)2=-4 has two complex solutions:
x=3+2i and x=3-2i.
x=3+2i and x=3-2i are called each others' complex conjugate.
Numbers of the form a+bi are called complex numbers.
In general a+bi and aÃ¢ÂˆÂ’bi are each other's complex conjugate.
A Gaussian Integer is a complex number a+bi such that both a and b are
integers.
The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with b=0).
To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with b Ã¢Â‰Â  0 we call such integers
"rational integers."
A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer n if the result is
also a Gaussian integer.
If for example we divide 5 by 1+2i we can simplify  in the following manner:
Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2i: 1Ã¢ÂˆÂ’2i.
The result is .
So 1+2i is a divisor of 5.
Note that 1+i is not a divisor of 5 because .
Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (a+bi) is a divisor of a rational
integer n, then its complex conjugate (aÃ¢ÂˆÂ’bi) is also a divisor of n.
In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1, 1 + 2i, 1
Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ 2i, 2 + i, 2 Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ i, 5}.
The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five positive
rational integers:
                 _____________________________________________
                |n|Gaussian integer divisors   |Sum s(n) of   |

A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each ball
rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.
Then, we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each position:
A path starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three spheres
directly below the current position.
Consequently, the number of paths to reach a certain position is the sum of the
numbers immediately above it (depending on the position, there are up to three
numbers above it).
The result is Pascal's pyramid and the numbers at each level n are the
coefficients of the trinomial expansion (x + y + z)n.
How many coefficients in the expansion of (x + y + z)200000 are multiples of
1012?

An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value C.
The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units,
which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other capacitors or
other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit.
Using this simple procedure and up to n identical capacitors, we can make
circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example, using up
to n=3 capacitors of 60 F each, we can obtain the following 7 distinct total
capacitance values:
If we denote by D(n) the number of distinct total capacitance values we can
obtain when using up to n equal-valued capacitors and the simple procedure
described above, we have: D(1)=1, D(2)=3, D(3)=7 ...
Find D(18).

Starting from zero the natural numbers are written down in base 10 like this:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12....
Consider the digit d=1. After we write down each number n, we will update the
number of ones that have occurred and call this number f(n,1). The first values
for f(n,1), then, are as follows:
                                   n  f(n,1)
                                   0  0

Note that f(n,1) never equals 3.
So the first two solutions of the equation f(n,1)=n are n=0 and n=1. The next
solution is n=199981.
In the same manner the function f(n,d) gives the total number of digits d that

In fact, for every digit d Ã¢Â‰Â  0, 0 is the first solution of the equation f
(n,d)=n.

Taking three different letters from the 26 letters of the alphabet, character
strings of length three can be formed.
Examples are 'abc', 'hat' and 'zyx'.
When we study these three examples we see that for 'abc' two characters come
lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
For 'hat' there is exactly one character that comes lexicographically after its
neighbour to the left. For 'zyx' there are zero characters that come
lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
In all there are 10400 strings of length 3 for which exactly one character
comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
We now consider strings of n Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 26 different characters from the alphabet.
For every n, p(n) is the number of strings of length n for which exactly one
character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
What is the maximum value of p(n)?

A composite number can be factored many different ways. For instance, not
including multiplication by one, 24 can be factored in 7 distinct ways:
24 = 2x2x2x3
24 = 2x3x4
24 = 2x2x6
24 = 4x6
24 = 3x8
24 = 2x12
24 = 24
Recall that the digital root of a number, in base 10, is found by adding
together the digits of that number, and repeating that process until a number
is arrived at that is less than 10. Thus the digital root of 467 is 8.
We shall call a Digital Root Sum (DRS) the sum of the digital roots of the
individual factors of our number.
The chart below demonstrates all of the DRS values for 24.

A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints.
By considering two line segments in plane geometry there are three
possibilities:
the segments have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in common.
Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be the
case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the segments or of
both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint of either of the
segments it is an interior point of both segments.
We will call a common point T of two segments L1 and L2 a true intersection
point of L1 and L2 if T is the only common point of L1 and L2 and T is an
interior point of both segments.
Consider the three segments L1, L2, and L3:
L1: (27, 44) to (12, 32)
L2: (46, 53) to (17, 62)
L3: (46, 70) to (22, 40)
It can be verified that line segments L2 and L3 have a true intersection point.
We note that as the one of the end points of L3: (22,40) lies on L1 this is not
considered to be a true point of intersection. L1 and L2 have no common point.
So among the three line segments, we find one true intersection point.
Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate 20000
numbers using the so-called "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number generator.
s0 = 290797

sn+1 = snÃƒÂ—sn (modulo 50515093)

tn = sn (modulo 500)
To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers tn. That is, the
first line segment is given by:
(t1, t2) to (t3, t4)
The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should be: 27,
144, 12 and 232. The first segment would thus be (27,144) to (12,232).
How many distinct true intersection points are found among the 5000 line
segments?

We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole" so
that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.
Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: 3x3 square
with a 1x1 hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles it is possible
to form two distinct laminae.
If t represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that t = 8 is type L(1)
and t = 32 is type L(2).
Let N(n) be the number of t Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 1000000 such that t is type L(n); for example,

Define f(0)=1 and f(n) to be the number of ways to write n as a sum of powers
of 2 where no power occurs more than twice.

For example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express 10:
10 = 8+2 = 8+1+1 = 4+4+2 = 4+2+2+1+1 = 4+4+1+1

It can be shown that for every fraction p/q (p>0, q>0) there exists at least
one integer n such that
f(n)/f(n-1)=p/q.

For instance, the smallest n for which f(n)/f(n-1)=13/17 is 241.
The binary expansion of 241 is 11110001.
Reading this binary number from the most significant bit to the least
significant bit there are 4 one's, 3 zeroes and 1 one. We shall call the string
4,3,1 the Shortened Binary Expansion of 241.

Find the Shortened Binary Expansion of the smallest n for which
f(n)/f(n-1)=123456789/987654321.

***** RSA encryption *****
**** Problem 182 ****
Published on Friday, 15th February 2008, 01:00 pm; Solved by 1747; Difficulty

The RSA encryption is based on the following procedure:
Generate two distinct primes p and q.
Compute n=pq and ÃÂ†=(p-1)(q-1).
Find an integer e, 1<e<ÃÂ†, such that gcd(e,ÃÂ†)=1.
A message in this system is a number in the interval [0,n-1].
A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers in the
interval [0,n-1]).
To encrypt the text, for each message, m, c=me mod n is calculated.
To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate d such that
ed=1 mod ÃÂ†, then for each encrypted message, c, calculate m=cd mod n.
There exist values of e and m such that me mod n=m.
We call messages m for which me mod n=m unconcealed messages.
An issue when choosing e is that there should not be too many unconcealed
messages.
For instance, let p=19 and q=37.
Then n=19*37=703 and ÃÂ†=18*36=648.
If we choose e=181, then, although gcd(181,648)=1 it turns out that all
possible messages
m (0Ã¢Â‰Â¤mÃ¢Â‰Â¤n-1) are unconcealed when calculating me mod n.
For any valid choice of e there exist some unconcealed messages.
It's important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum.
Choose p=1009 and q=3643.
Find the sum of all values of e, 1<e<ÃÂ†(1009,3643) and gcd(e,ÃÂ†)=1, so that the
number of unconcealed messages for this value of e is at a minimum.



***** Maximum product of parts *****
**** Problem 183 ****

rating: 45%
Let N be a positive integer and let N be split into k equal parts, r = N/k, so
that N = r + r + ... + r.
Let P be the product of these parts, P = r ÃƒÂ— r ÃƒÂ— ... ÃƒÂ— r = rk.
For example, if 11 is split into five equal parts, 11 = 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 +
2.2, then P = 2.25 = 51.53632.
Let M(N) = Pmax for a given value of N.
It turns out that the maximum for N = 11 is found by splitting eleven into four
equal parts which leads to Pmax = (11/4)4; that is, M(11) = 14641/256 =
57.19140625, which is a terminating decimal.
However, for N = 8 the maximum is achieved by splitting it into three equal
parts, so M(8) = 512/27, which is a non-terminating decimal.
Let D(N) = N if M(N) is a non-terminating decimal and D(N) = -N if M(N) is a
terminating decimal.
For example, ÃŽÂ£D(N) for 5 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ N Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 100 is 2438.

We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form, p2q3, where p and q are
distinct primes.
For example, 200 = 5223 or 120072949 = 232613.
The first five squbes are 72, 108, 200, 392, and 500.
Interestingly, 200 is also the first number for which you cannot change any
single digit to make a prime; we shall call such numbers, prime-proof. The next
prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous sub-string "200" is 1992008.
Find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200".

For any set A of numbers, let sum(A) be the sum of the elements of A.
Consider the set B = {1,3,6,8,10,11}.
There are 20 subsets of B containing three elements, and their sums are:
sum({1,3,6}) = 10,
sum({1,3,8}) = 12,
sum({1,3,10}) = 14,
sum({1,3,11}) = 15,
sum({1,6,8}) = 15,
sum({1,6,10}) = 17,
sum({1,6,11}) = 18,
sum({1,8,10}) = 19,
sum({1,8,11}) = 20,
sum({1,10,11}) = 22,
sum({3,6,8}) = 17,
sum({3,6,10}) = 19,
sum({3,6,11}) = 20,
sum({3,8,10}) = 21,
sum({3,8,11}) = 22,
sum({3,10,11}) = 24,
sum({6,8,10}) = 24,
sum({6,8,11}) = 25,
sum({6,10,11}) = 27,
sum({8,10,11}) = 29.
Some of these sums occur more than once, others are unique.
For a set A, let U(A,k) be the set of unique sums of k-element subsets of A, in
our example we find U(B,3) = {10,12,14,18,21,25,27,29} and sum(U(B,3)) = 156.
Now consider the 100-element set S = {12, 22, ... , 1002}.
S has 100891344545564193334812497256 50-element subsets.

having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die roll it.
If a player rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour on the left; if he
rolls a 6, he passes the die to his neighbour on the right; otherwise, he keeps
the die for the next turn.
The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled and
passed; that player has then lost.
In a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the game
lasts?

Let Sn be the regular n-sided polygon Ã¢Â€Â“ or shape Ã¢Â€Â“ whose vertices vk
(kÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰1,2,Ã¢Â€Â¦,n) have coordinates:
 xkÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â‰Ã‚Â = Ã¢Â€Â‰ cos( 2k-1/n ÃƒÂ—180Ã‚Â°Ã¢Â€Â‰)
 ykÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â‰Ã‚Â = Ã‚Â  sin( 2k-1/n ÃƒÂ—180Ã‚Â°Ã¢Â€Â‰)
Each Sn is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points on the
perimeter and in the interior.
The Minkowski sum, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of adding every
point in S to every point in T, where point addition is performed coordinate-
wise: (u,Ã¢Â€Â‰v) + (x,Ã¢Â€Â‰y) = (u+x,Ã¢Â€Â‰v+y).

3600 = 202 + 2ÃƒÂ—402

3600 = 302 + 3ÃƒÂ—302

3600 = 452 + 7ÃƒÂ—152

For any two strings of digits, A and B, we define FA,B to be the sequence
(A,B,AB,BAB,ABBAB,...) in which each term is the concatenation of the previous
two.
Further, we define DA,B(n) to be the nth digit in the first term of FA,B that
contains at least n digits.
Example:
Let A=1415926535, B=8979323846. We wish to find DA,B(35), say.
The first few terms of FA,B are:
1415926535
8979323846
14159265358979323846

14159265358979323846897932384614159265358979323846
Then DA,B(35) is the 35th digit in the fifth term, which is 9.
Now we use for A the first 100 digits of ÃÂ€ behind the decimal point:

For an integer n Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 4, we define the lower prime square root of n, denoted by
lps(n), as the largest prime Ã¢Â‰Â¤ Ã¢ÂˆÂšn and the upper prime square root of n, ups
(n), as the smallest prime Ã¢Â‰Â¥ Ã¢ÂˆÂšn.
So, for example, lps(4) = 2 = ups(4), lps(1000) = 31, ups(1000) = 37.
Let us call an integer n Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 4 semidivisible, if one of lps(n) and ups(n)
divides n, but not both.
The sum of the semidivisible numbers not exceeding 15 is 30, the numbers are 8,
10 and 12.
15 is not semidivisible because it is a multiple of both lps(15) = 3 and ups

                         Champagne Truffles 3936 5664
Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect condition,
there is inevitably some spoilage - i.e. products gone bad.
The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:
    * The five per-product spoilage rates for each supplier are equal to the
      number of products gone bad divided by the number of products supplied,
      for each of the five products in turn.
    * The overall spoilage rate for each supplier is equal to the total number
      of products gone bad divided by the total number of products provided by
      that supplier.
To their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product
spoilage rates was worse (higher) for 'B' than for 'A' by the same factor
(ratio of spoilage rates), m>1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall spoilage
rate was worse for 'A' than for 'B', also by a factor of m.
There are thirty-five m>1 for which this surprising result could have occurred,

                            sn+1 = sn2 mod 20300713
Concatenate these numbers Ã¢Â€Â‰s0s1s2Ã¢Â€Â¦ to create a string w of infinite length.
Then, wÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰14025256741014958470038053646Ã¢Â€Â¦
For a positive integer k, if no substring of w exists with a sum of digits
equal to k, p(k) is defined to be zero. If at least one substring of w exists
with a sum of digits equal to k, we define p(k)Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰z, where z is the
starting position of the earliest such substring.
For instance:
The substrings 1, 14, 1402, Ã¢Â€Â¦
with respective sums of digits equal to 1, 5, 7, Ã¢Â€Â¦
start at position 1, hence p(1)Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰p(5)Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰p(7)Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰Ã¢Â€Â¦Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰1.
The substrings 4, 402, 4025, Ã¢Â€Â¦
with respective sums of digits equal to 4, 6, 11, Ã¢Â€Â¦
start at position 2, hence p(4)Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰p(6)Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰p(11)Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰Ã¢Â€Â¦Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰2.
The substrings 02, 0252, Ã¢Â€Â¦
with respective sums of digits equal to 2, 9, Ã¢Â€Â¦
start at position 3, hence p(2)Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰p(9)Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰Ã¢Â€Â¦Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰3.
Note that substring 025 starting at position 3, has a sum of digits equal to 7,
but there was an earlier substring (starting at position 1) with a sum of
digits equal to 7, so p(7)Ã¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰1, not 3.
We can verify that, for 0Ã¢Â€Â‰<Ã¢Â€Â‰kÃ¢Â€Â‰Ã¢Â‰Â¤Ã¢Â€Â‰103, Ã¢ÂˆÂ‘Ã¢Â€Â‰p(k) = 4742.

Given a set of points on a plane, we define a convex hole to be a convex
polygon having as vertices any of the given points and not containing any of
the given points in its interior (in addition to the vertices, other given
points may lie on the perimeter of the polygon).
As an example, the image below shows a set of twenty points and a few such
convex holes. The convex hole shown as a red heptagon has an area equal to
1049694.5 square units, which is the highest possible area for a convex hole on
the given set of points.
For our example, we used the first 20 points (T2kÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1,Ã¢Â€Â‰T2k), for
kÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰1,2,Ã¢Â€Â¦,20, produced with the pseudo-random number generator:
                    S0   =Ã‚Â290797Ã‚Â

A small child has a Ã¢Â€Âœnumber caterpillarÃ¢Â€Â consisting of forty jigsaw pieces,
each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a line, reveal
the numbers 1 to 40 in order.
Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the caterpillar
that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the pieces at random
and places them in the correct order.
As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that
gradually merge together.
The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases
up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before finishing at a
single segment (all pieces placed).
For example:
                         ____________________________
                        |Piece_Placed|Segments_So_Far|

                        |_____Ã¢Â€Â¦_|_______Ã¢Â€Â¦__|
Let M be the maximum number of segments encountered during a random tidy-up of
the caterpillar.
For a caterpillar of ten pieces, the number of possibilities for each M is

Define f(n) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of n. For example, f
(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.
Define sf(n) as the sum of the digits of f(n). So sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.
Define g(i) to be the smallest positive integer n such that sf(n) = i. Though
sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified that g(5) is 25.
Define sg(i) as the sum of the digits of g(i). So sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.
Further, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and Ã¢ÂˆÂ‘Ã¢Â€Â‰sg(i) for 1 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ i Ã¢Â‰Â¤

***** Rounded Square Roots *****
**** Problem 255 ****
Published on Friday, 11th September 2009, 09:00 pm; Solved by 635; Difficulty
rating: 75%
We define the rounded-square-root of a positive integer n as the square root of
n rounded to the nearest integer.
The following procedure (essentially Heron's method adapted to integer
arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of n:
Let d be the number of digits of the number n.
If d is odd, set x0 = 2ÃƒÂ—10(d-1)Ã¢ÂÂ„2.
If d is even, set x0 = 7ÃƒÂ—10(d-2)Ã¢ÂÂ„2.
Repeat:
                               [p255_Heron.gif]
until xk+1 = xk.
As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of n = 4321.
n has 4 digits, so x0 = 7ÃƒÂ—10(4-2)Ã¢ÂÂ„2 = 70.
[p255_Example.gif]
Since x2 = x1, we stop here.
So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root of
4321 is 66 (the actual square root is 65.7343137Ã¢Â€Â¦).
The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly low.
For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a 5-digit integer (10,000
Ã¢Â‰Â¤ n Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 99,999) with an average of 3.2102888889 iterations (the average value
was rounded to 10 decimal places).
Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of iterations
required to find the rounded-square-root of a 14-digit number (1013 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ n <
1014)?
Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.

***** Tatami-Free Rooms *****
**** Problem 256 ****
Published on Saturday, 19th September 2009, 01:00 am; Solved by 505; Difficulty
rating: 80%
Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room,
without overlap.
Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1ÃƒÂ—2, there are
obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be
covered.
For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions a,
b and even size s = aÃ‚Â·b.
We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and Ã¢Â€Â”
without loss of generality Ã¢Â€Â” we add the condition a Ã¢Â‰Â¤ b.
There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points
where corners of four different mats meet.
For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4ÃƒÂ—4 room:
                              [p256_tatami3.gif]
The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not:
a red "X" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.
Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami:
we call them tatami-free rooms.
Further, we define T(s) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size s.
The smallest tatami-free room has size s = 70 and dimensions 7ÃƒÂ—10.
All the other rooms of size s = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are: 1ÃƒÂ—70,
2ÃƒÂ—35 and 5ÃƒÂ—14.
Hence, T(70) = 1.
Similarly, we can verify that T(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5 tatami-
free rooms of size s = 1320:
20ÃƒÂ—66, 22ÃƒÂ—60, 24ÃƒÂ—55, 30ÃƒÂ—44 and 33ÃƒÂ—40.
In fact, s = 1320 is the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 5.
Find the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 200.

A positive integer will be called reachable if it can result from an arithmetic
expression obeying the following rules:
    * Uses the digits 1 through 9, in that order and exactly once each.
    * Any successive digits can be concatenated (for example, using the digits
      2, 3 and 4 we obtain the number 234).
    * Only the four usual binary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
      multiplication and division) are allowed.
    * Each operation can be used any number of times, or not at all.
    * Unary minus is not allowed.
    * Any number of (possibly nested) parentheses may be used to define the

A game is played with three piles of stones and two players.
At her turn, a player removes one or more stones from the piles. However, if
she takes stones from more than one pile, she must remove the same number of
stones from each of the selected piles.
In other words, the player chooses some N>0 and removes:
    * N stones from any single pile; or
    * N stones from each of any two piles (2N total); or
    * N stones from each of the three piles (3N total).
The player taking the last stone(s) wins the game.
A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win.
For example, (0,0,13), (0,11,11) and (5,5,5) are winning configurations because
the first player can immediately remove all stones.
A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no
matter what the first player does.
For example, (0,1,2) and (1,3,3) are losing configurations: any legal move
leaves a winning configuration for the second player.
Consider all losing configurations (xi,yi,zi) where xi Ã¢Â‰Â¤ yi Ã¢Â‰Â¤ zi Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 100.
We can verify that ÃŽÂ£(xi+yi+zi) = 173895 for these.

For N=3, two such circular arrangements are possible, ignoring rotations:

For the first arrangement, the 3-digit subsequences, in clockwise order, are:

Each circular arrangement can be encoded as a number by concatenating the
binary digits starting with the subsequence of all zeros as the most

Consider equations of the form: a2 + b2 = N, 0 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ a Ã¢Â‰Â¤ b, a, b and N integer.
For N=65 there are two solutions:
a=1, b=8 and a=4, b=7.
We call S(N) the sum of the values of a of all solutions of a2 + b2 = N, 0 Ã¢Â‰Â¤
a Ã¢Â‰Â¤ b, a, b and N integer.
Thus S(65) = 1 + 4 = 5.
Find Ã¢ÂˆÂ‘S(N), for all squarefree N only divisible by primes of the form 4k+1

***** Divisibility Multipliers *****
**** Problem 274 ****
Published on Friday, 15th January 2010, 01:00 pm; Solved by 1020; Difficulty
rating: 65%
For each integer p > 1 coprime to 10 there is a positive divisibility
multiplier m < p which preserves divisibility by p for the following function
on any positive integer, n:
f(n) = (all but the last digit of n) + (the last digit of n) * m
That is, if m is the divisibility multiplier for p, then f(n) is divisible by p
if and only if n is divisible by p.
(When n is much larger than p, f(n) will be less than n and repeated
application of f provides a multiplicative divisibility test for p.)
For example, the divisibility multiplier for 113 is 34.
f(76275) = 7627 + 5 * 34 = 7797 : 76275 and 7797 are both divisible by 113
f(12345) = 1234 + 5 * 34 = 1404 : 12345 and 1404 are both not divisible by 113
The sum of the divisibility multipliers for the primes that are coprime to 10
and less than 1000 is 39517. What is the sum of the divisibility multipliers
for the primes that are coprime to 10 and less than 107?



***** Balanced Sculptures *****

Let us define a balanced sculpture of order n as follows:
    * A polyomino made up of n+1 tiles known as the blocks (n tiles)
      and the plinth (remaining tile);
    * the plinth has its centre at position (xÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰0, yÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰0);
    * the blocks have y-coordinates greater than zero (so the plinth is the
      unique lowest tile);
    * the centre of mass of all the blocks, combined, has x-coordinate equal to
      zero.
When counting the sculptures, any arrangements which are simply reflections
about the y-axis, are not counted as distinct. For example, the 18 balanced
sculptures of order 6 are shown below; note that each pair of mirror images
(about the y-axis) is counted as one sculpture:

***** A Modified Collatz sequence *****
**** Problem 277 ****
Published on Saturday, 6th February 2010, 01:00 am; Solved by 2167; Difficulty
rating: 35%
A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value a1 in
the following way:
an+1 = an/3 if an is divisible by 3. We shall denote this as a large downward
step, "D".
an+1 = (4an + 2)/3 if an divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1. We shall denote
this as an upward step, "U".
an+1 = (2an - 1)/3 if an divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2. We shall denote
this as a small downward step, "d".
The sequence terminates when some an = 1.
Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.
For instance if a1=231, then the sequence {an}={231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1}
corresponds to the steps "DdDddUUdDD".
Of course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence
"DdDddUUdDD....".
For instance, if a1=1004064, then the sequence is
DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD.
In fact, 1004064 is the smallest possible a1 > 106 that begins with the
sequence DdDddUUdDD.
What is the smallest a1 > 1015 that begins with the sequence
"UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd"?

Given the values of integers 1 < a1 < a2 <... < an, consider the linear
combination
q1a1 + q2a2 + ... + qnan = b, using only integer values qk Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 0.
Note that for a given set of ak, it may be that not all values of b are
possible.
For instance, if a1 = 5 and a2 = 7, there are no q1 Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 0 and q2 Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 0 such
that b could be
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18 or 23.
In fact, 23 is the largest impossible value of b for a1 = 5 and a2 = 7.
We therefore call f(5, 7) = 23.
Similarly, it can be shown that f(6, 10, 15)=29 and f(14, 22, 77) = 195.
Find Ã¢ÂˆÂ‘ f(p*q,p*r,q*r), where p, q and r are prime numbers and p &lt q < r <

A laborious ant walks randomly on a 5x5 grid. The walk starts from the central
square. At each step, the ant moves to an adjacent square at random, without
leaving the grid; thus there are 2, 3 or 4 possible moves at each step
depending on the ant's position.
At the start of the walk, a seed is placed on each square of the lower row.
When the ant isn't carrying a seed and reaches a square of the lower row
containing a seed, it will start to carry the seed. The ant will drop the seed
on the first empty square of the upper row it eventually reaches.

Albert chooses a positive integer k, then two real numbers a, b are randomly
chosen in the interval [0,1] with uniform distribution.
The square root of the sum (kÃ‚Â·a+1)2Ã¢Â€Â‰+Ã¢Â€Â‰(kÃ‚Â·b+1)2 is then computed and
rounded to the nearest integer. If the result is equal to k, he scores k
points; otherwise he scores nothing.
For example, if kÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰6, aÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰0.2 and bÃ¢Â€Â‰=Ã¢Â€Â‰0.85, then (kÃ‚Â·a+1)2Ã¢Â€Â‰+Ã¢Â€Â‰

The square root of 42.05 is 6.484... and when rounded to the nearest integer,
it becomes 6.
This is equal to k, so he scores 6 points.

***** Three similar triangles *****
**** Problem 299 ****
Published on Saturday, 3rd July 2010, 01:00 am; Solved by 441; Difficulty

Four points with integer coordinates are selected:
A(a,Ã‚Â 0), B(b,Ã‚Â 0), C(0,Ã‚Â c) and D(0,Ã‚Â d), with 0Ã‚Â <Ã‚Â aÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â b and
0Ã‚Â <Ã‚Â cÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â d.
Point P, also with integer coordinates, is chosen on the line AC so that the
three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP are all similar.
                            [p299_ThreeSimTri.gif]
It is easy to prove that the three triangles can be similar, only if a=c.
So, given that a=c, we are looking for triplets (a,b,d) such that at least one
point P (with integer coordinates) exists on AC, making the three triangles
ABP, CDP and BDP all similar.
For example, if (a,b,d)=(2,3,4), it can be easily verified that point P(1,1)
satisfies the above condition. Note that the triplets (2,3,4) and (2,4,3) are
considered as distinct, although point P(1,1) is common for both.
If b+dÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 100, there are 92 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point P
exists.
If b+dÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 100 000, there are 320471 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point
P exists.
If b+dÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 100 000 000, how many distinct triplets (a,b,d) are there such that
point P exists?



***** Protein folding *****
**** Problem 300 ****
Published on Saturday, 4th September 2010, 01:00 pm; Solved by 729; Difficulty
rating: 50%
In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting of
hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH.
For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is
considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are 2n distinct proteins consisting
of n elements.
When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a
way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this
is energetically advantageous.
As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-
elements on the outside.
Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only
consider protein folding in two_dimensions.
The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be
folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).
                              [p300_protein.gif]
The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would never
occur naturally.
On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which
is optimal for this string.
Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position
along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal
folding of a random protein string of length 8 turns out to be 850Ã‚Â /
Ã‚Â 28=3.3203125.
What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a
random protein string of length 15?
Give your answer using as many decimal places as necessary for an exact result.



***** Nim *****
**** Problem 301 ****
Published on Saturday, 11th September 2010, 04:00 pm; Solved by 3857;
Difficulty rating: 15%
Nim is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players take it in turn to
remove any number of stones from any heap until no stones remain.
We'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as
follows:
- At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.
- On his turn the player removes any positive number of stones from any single
heap.
- The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.
If (n1,n2,n3) indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size n1, n2 and
n3 then there is a simple function X(n1,n2,n3) Ã¢Â€Â” that you may look up or
attempt to deduce for yourself Ã¢Â€Â” that returns:
    * zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually
      lose; or
    * non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will
      eventually win.
For example X(1,2,3) = 0 because, no matter what the current player does, his
opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size, at which
point every move by the current player can be mirrored by his opponent until no
stones remain; so the current player loses. To illustrate:
- current player moves to (1,2,1)
- opponent moves to (1,0,1)
- current player moves to (0,0,1)
- opponent moves to (0,0,0), and so wins.
For how many positive integers nÃ¢Â€Â‰Ã¢Â‰Â¤Ã¢Â€Â‰230 does X(n,2n,3n) = 0 ?

A positive integer n is powerful if p2 is a divisor of n for every prime factor
p in n.
A positive integer n is a perfect power if n can be expressed as a power of
another positive integer.
A positive integer n is an Achilles number if n is powerful but not a perfect
power. For example, 864 and 1800 are Achilles numbers: 864 = 25Ã‚Â·33 and 1800 =
23Ã‚Â·32Ã‚Â·52.
We shall call a positive integer S a Strong Achilles number if both S and ÃÂ†(S)
are Achilles numbers.1
For example, 864 is a Strong Achilles number: ÃÂ†(864) = 288 = 25Ã‚Â·32. However,
1800 isn't a Strong Achilles number because: ÃÂ†(1800) = 480 = 25Ã‚Â·31Ã‚Â·51.

The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:
Two players start with a strip of n white squares and they take alternate
turns.
On each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints them
black.
The first player who cannot make a move loses.
    * If n = 1, there are no valid moves, so the first player loses
      automatically.
    * If n = 2, there is only one valid move, after which the second player
      loses.
    * If n = 3, there are two valid moves, but both leave a situation where the
      second player loses.
    * If n = 4, there are three valid moves for the first player; she can win
      the game by painting the two middle squares.
    * If n = 5, there are four valid moves for the first player (shown below in

***** An amazing Prime-generating Automaton *****

rating: 60%
A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a list of
fractions.
The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer, which
is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran program
multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in the list which will leave
it an integer.
For example, one of the Fractran programs that John Horton Conway wrote for
prime-generation consists of the following 14 fractions:
17 , 78 , 19 , 23 , 29 , 77 , 95 , 77 , 1  , 11 , 13 , 15 , 1 , 55 .
91   85   51   38   33   29   23   19   17   13   11   2    7   1
Starting with the seed integer 2, successive iterations of the program produce
the sequence:
15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, ..., 68, 4, 30, ..., 136, 8, 60, ..., 544, 32,
240, ...
The powers of 2 that appear in this sequence are 22, 23, 25, ...
It can be shown that all the powers of 2 in this sequence have prime exponents
and that all the primes appear as exponents of powers of 2, in proper order!
If someone uses the above Fractran program to solve Project Euler Problem 7
(find the 10001st prime), how many iterations would be needed until the program
produces 210001st prime ?

The moon has been opened up, and land can be obtained for free, but there is a
catch. You have to build a wall around the land that you stake out, and
building a wall on the moon is expensive. Every country has been allotted a 500
m by 500 m square area, but they will possess only that area which they wall
in. 251001 posts have been placed in a rectangular grid with 1 meter spacing.
The wall must be a closed series of straight lines, each line running from post
to post.
The bigger countries of course have built a 2000 m wall enclosing the entire
250 000 m2 area. The Duchy_of_Grand_Fenwick, has a tighter budget, and has
asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape would get best maximum
enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.
You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper. For a 2000
meter wall enclosing the 250 000 m2 area the enclosed-area/wall-length ratio is
125.
Although not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better: if you
place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area will be
equal to ÃÂ€*2502 m2 and the perimeter will be ÃÂ€*500 m, so the enclosed-area/
wall-length ratio will also be 125.
However, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m, 75 m
and 75Ã¢ÂˆÂš2 m the total area becomes 238750 m2 and the perimeter becomes
1400+300Ã¢ÂˆÂš2 m. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length ratio of 130.87,
which is significantly better.

                               [p315_clocks.gif]
Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two "digital root"
clocks.
A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step by
step.
When a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the
calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the result.
For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: "137" Ã¢Â†Â’ "11"
Ã¢Â†Â’ "2" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.
Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal (top,
middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-
right).
Number "1" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number "4" is made
by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and bottom-right. Number
"8" lights them all.
The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.
To turn on a "2" will cost 5 transitions, while a "7" will cost only 4
transitions.
Sam and Max built two different clocks.
Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows "137", then the panel is
turned off, then the next number ("11") is turned on, then the panel is turned
off again and finally the last number ("2") is turned on and, after some time,
off.
For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:
"137" : (2 + 5 + 4) ÃƒÂ— 2 = 22 transitions ("137" on/off).
"11"  : (2 + 2) ÃƒÂ— 2 = 8 transitions ("11" on/off).
"2"   : (5) ÃƒÂ— 2 = 10 transitions ("2" on/off).
For a grand total of 40 transitions.
Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is
smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next
number.
For number 137, Max's clock requires:
"137" : 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions ("137" on)
        7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number
        "11").
"11"  : 0 transitions (number "11" is already turned on correctly)
        3 transitions (to turn off the first "1" and the bottom part of the
        second "1";
        the top part is common with number "2").
"2"   : 4 transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a "2")
        5 transitions (to turn off number "2").
For a grand total of 30 transitions.
Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.
The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 107 and B = 2ÃƒÂ—107.
Find the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's
clock and that needed by Max's one.

When we calculate the even powers of Ã¢ÂˆÂš2+Ã¢ÂˆÂš3 we get:
(Ã¢ÂˆÂš2+Ã¢ÂˆÂš3)2 = 9.898979485566356...
(Ã¢ÂˆÂš2+Ã¢ÂˆÂš3)4 = 97.98979485566356...

***** Stone Game II *****
**** Problem 325 ****

rating: 80%
A game is played with two piles of stones and two players. At her turn, a
player removes a number of stones from the larger pile. The number of stones
she removes must be a positive multiple of the number of stones in the smaller
pile.
E.g., let the ordered pair(6,14) describe a configuration with 6 stones in the
smaller pile and 14 stones in the larger pile, then the first player can remove
6 or 12 stones from the larger pile.
The player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.
A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win. For
example, (1,5), (2,6) and (3,12) are winning configurations because the first
player can immediately remove all stones in the second pile.
A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no
matter what the first player does. For example, (2,3) and (3,4) are losing
configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second
player.
Define S(N) as the sum of (xi+yi) for all losing configurations (xi,yi), 0 < xi

A series of three rooms are connected to each other by automatic doors.
                           [p327_rooms_of_doom.gif]
Each door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door
automatically closes and that security card cannot be used again. A machine at
the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but each room (including
the starting room) contains scanners and if they detect that you are holding
more than three security cards or if they detect an unattended security card on
the floor, then all the doors will become permanently locked. However, each
room contains a box where you may safely store any number of security cards for
use at a later stage.
If you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as you
entered room 3 you would have used all three cards and would be trapped in that
room forever!
However, if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is possible. For
example, you could enter room 1 using your first card, place one card in the
storage box, and use your third card to exit the room back to the start. Then
after collecting three more cards from the dispensing machine you could use one
to enter room 1 and collect the card you placed in the box a moment ago. You
now have three cards again and will be able to travel through the remaining
three doors. This method allows you to travel through all three rooms using six
security cards in total.
It is possible to travel through six rooms using a total of 123 security cards
while carrying a maximum of 3 cards.
Let C be the maximum number of cards which can be carried at any time.
Let R be the number of rooms to travel through.
Let M(C,R) be the minimum number of cards required from the dispensing machine
to travel through R rooms carrying up to a maximum of C cards at any time.
For example, M(3,6)=123 and M(4,6)=23.
And, ÃŽÂ£M(C,6)=146 for 3 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ C Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 4.
You are given that ÃŽÂ£M(C,10)=10382 for 3 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ C Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 10.

***** Lowest-cost Search *****
**** Problem 328 ****
Published on Saturday, 12th March 2011, 10:00 pm; Solved by 262; Difficulty
rating: 95%
We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2,
..., n} by asking questions. Each number (question) we ask, has a cost_equal_to
the_number_asked and we get one of three possible answers:
    * "Your guess is lower than the hidden number", or
    * "Yes, that's it!", or
    * "Your guess is higher than the hidden number".
Given the value of n, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost (i.e. the
sum of all the questions asked) for_the_worst_possible_case. E.g.
If n=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number "2". The answer will
immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).
If n=8, we might decide to use a "binary search" type of strategy: Our first
question would be "4" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we will need
one or two additional questions.
Let our second question be "6". If the hidden number is still higher than 6, we
will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.
Thus, our third question will be "7" and the total cost for this worst-case
scenario will be 4+6+7=17.
We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for n=8, by asking "5" as our
first question.
If we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second question
will be "7", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total
cost of 5+7=12).
If we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question will
be "3" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will be "1",
giving a total cost of 5+3+1=9.
Since 12>9, the worst-case cost for this strategy is 12. That's better than
what we achieved previously with the "binary search" strategy; it is also
better than or equal to any other strategy.
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for n=8.
Let C(n) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for n, as
described above.
Thus C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 2 and C(8) = 12.
Similarly, C(100) = 400 and [p328_sum1.gif]C(n) = 17575.

All positive integers can be partitioned in such a way that each and every term
of the partition can be expressed as 2ix3j, where i,j Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 0.
Let's consider only those such partitions where none of the terms can divide
any of the other terms.
For example, the partition of 17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (21x30 + 21x31 + 20x32) would
not be valid since 2 can divide 6. Neither would the partition 17 = 16 + 1 =
(24x30 + 20x30) since 1 can divide 16. The only valid partition of 17 would be
8 + 9 = (23x30 + 20x32).
Many integers have more than one valid partition, the first being 11 having the
following two partitions.
11 = 2 + 9 = (21x30 + 20x32)
11 = 8 + 3 = (23x30 + 20x31)
Let's define P(n) as the number of valid partitions of n. For example, P(11) =

A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However,
sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in the
correct order.
To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating
turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the train
moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The
remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the carriages are then
rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to obtain
the least number of uses of the turntable.
Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are
separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order has been
achieved.
However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he
always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the correct place,
then carriage B, and so on.
Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we shall
call maximix arrangements, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring him five rotations
(although, using the most efficient approach, they could be solved using just
three rotations). The process he uses for DACB is shown below.

95%
A rectangular sheet of grid paper with integer dimensions w ÃƒÂ— h is given. Its
grid spacing is 1.
When we cut the sheet along the grid lines into two pieces and rearrange those
pieces without overlap, we can make new rectangles with different dimensions.
For example, from a sheet with dimensions 9 ÃƒÂ— 4 , we can make rectangles with
dimensions 18 ÃƒÂ— 2, 12 ÃƒÂ— 3 and 6 ÃƒÂ— 6 by cutting and rearranging as below:
                             [p338_gridpaper.gif]
Similarly, from a sheet with dimensions 9 ÃƒÂ— 8 , we can make rectangles with
dimensions 18 ÃƒÂ— 4 and 12 ÃƒÂ— 6 .
For a pair w and h, let F(w,h) be the number of distinct rectangles that can be
made from a sheet with dimensions w ÃƒÂ— h .
For example, F(2,1) = 0, F(2,2) = 1, F(9,4) = 3 and F(9,8) = 2.
Note that rectangles congruent to the initial one are not counted in F(w,h).
Note also that rectangles with dimensions w ÃƒÂ— h and dimensions h ÃƒÂ— w are not
considered distinct.
For an integer N, let G(N) be the sum of F(w,h) for all pairs w and h which
satisfy 0 < h Ã¢Â‰Â¤ w Ã¢Â‰Â¤ N.
We can verify that G(10) = 55, G(103) = 971745 and G(105) = 9992617687.
Find G(1012). Give your answer modulo 108.

"And he came towards a valley, through which ran a river; and the borders of
the valley were wooded, and on each side of the river were level meadows. And
on one side of the river he saw a flock of white sheep, and on the other a
flock of black sheep. And whenever one of the white sheep bleated, one of the
black sheep would cross over and become white; and when one of the black sheep
bleated, one of the white sheep would cross over and become black."

Initially each flock consists of n sheep. Each sheep (regardless of colour) is
equally likely to be the next sheep to bleat. After a sheep has bleated and a
sheep from the other flock has crossed over, Peredur may remove a number of
white sheep in order to maximize the expected final number of black sheep. Let
E(n) be the expected final number of black sheep if Peredur uses an optimal
strategy.
You are given that E(5) = 6.871346 rounded to 6 places behind the decimal

For any positive integer k, a finite sequence ai of fractions xi/yi is defined
by:
a1 = 1/k and
ai = (xi-1+1)/(yi-1-1) reduced to lowest terms for i>1.
When ai reaches some integer n, the sequence stops. (That is, when yi=1.)
Define f(k) = n.
For example, for k = 20:
1/20 Ã¢Â†Â’ 2/19 Ã¢Â†Â’ 3/18 = 1/6 Ã¢Â†Â’ 2/5 Ã¢Â†Â’ 3/4 Ã¢Â†Â’ 4/3 Ã¢Â†Â’ 5/2 Ã¢Â†Â’ 6/1 = 6

rating: 100%
One variant of N.G. de Bruijn's silver dollar game can be described as follows:
On a strip of squares a number of coins are placed, at most one coin per
square. Only one coin, called the silver dollar, has any value. Two players
take turns making moves. At each turn a player must make either a regular or a
special move.
A regular move consists of selecting one coin and moving it one or more squares
to the left. The coin cannot move out of the strip or jump on or over another
coin.
Alternatively, the player can choose to make the special move of pocketing the
leftmost coin rather than making a regular move. If no regular moves are
possible, the player is forced to pocket the leftmost coin.
The winner is the player who pockets the silver dollar.
                            [p344_silverdollar.gif]
A winning configuration is an arrangement of coins on the strip where the first
player can force a win no matter what the second player does.
Let W(n,c) be the number of winning configurations for a strip of n squares, c
worthless coins and one silver dollar.
You are given that W(10,2) = 324 and W(100,10) = 1514704946113500.

such a positive integer does not exist.
E.g. M(2,3,100)=96.
M(3,5,100)=75 and not 90 because 90 is divisible by 2 ,3 and 5.
Also M(2,73,100)=0 because there does not exist a positive integer Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 100 that

A list of size n is a sequence of n natural numbers.
Examples are (2,4,6), (2,6,4), (10,6,15,6), and (11).
The greatest common divisor, or gcd, of a list is the largest natural number
that divides all entries of the list.
Examples: gcd(2,6,4) = 2, gcd(10,6,15,6) = 1 and gcd(11) = 11.
The least common multiple, or lcm, of a list is the smallest natural number
divisible by each entry of the list.
Examples: lcm(2,6,4) = 12, lcm(10,6,15,6) = 30 and lcm(11) = 11.
Let f(G, L, N) be the number of lists of size N with gcd Ã¢Â‰Â¥ G and lcm Ã¢Â‰Â¤ L.

***** Blood tests *****
**** Problem 352 ****
Published on Sunday, 2nd October 2011, 01:00 am; Solved by 399; Difficulty
rating: 55%
Each one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known to
affect 2% of the sheep population. An accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test
exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative result, but it
is very time-consuming and expensive.
Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing
25 separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:

The sheep are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group. For each group, the
5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed. Then,
    * If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be
      virus-free.
    * If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a
      separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).
Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the
first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:
    * Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.985 =
      0.9039207968.
    * Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 =
      0.0960792032.
Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 ÃƒÂ— 5 =
1.480396016.
Consequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016
ÃƒÂ— 5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !
Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can
still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently
sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different
samples). E.g.:
    * We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can
      be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative,
      thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required
      for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.
    * If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the
      first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a
      test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).
    * We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in
      each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total
      expected number of tests will be minimised.
To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we
place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start
with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully
screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of
them) before we start examining any other animals.
For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing
scheme (we'll call it the optimal strategy) requires an average of just
4.155452 tests!
Using the optimal strategy, let T(s,p) represent the average number of tests
needed to screen a flock of s sheep for a virus having probability p to be
present in any individual.
Thus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25, 0.10) =
12.702124.
Find ÃŽÂ£T(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.

A moon could be described by the sphere C(r) with centre (0,0,0) and radius r.
There are stations on the moon at the points on the surface of C(r) with
integer coordinates. The station at (0,0,r) is called North Pole station, the
station at (0,0,-r) is called South Pole station.
All stations are connected with each other via the shortest road on the great
arc through the stations. A journey between two stations is risky. If d is the
length of the road between two stations, (d/(ÃÂ€ r))2 is a measure for the risk
of the journey (let us call it the risk of the road). If the journey includes
more than two stations, the risk of the journey is the sum of risks of the used
roads.
A direct journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station has the
length ÃÂ€r and risk 1. The journey from the North Pole station to the South
Pole station via (0,r,0) has the same length, but a smaller risk: (Ã‚Â½ÃÂ€r/

***** Hilbert's New Hotel *****
**** Problem 359 ****
Published on Saturday, 19th November 2011, 10:00 pm; Solved by 930; Difficulty
rating: 25%
An infinite number of people (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.) are lined up to get a
room at Hilbert's newest infinite hotel. The hotel contains an infinite number
of floors (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.), and each floor contains an infinite number
of rooms (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.).
Initially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the nth person is
assigned a room: person n gets the first vacant room in the lowest numbered
floor satisfying either of the following:
    * the floor is empty
    * the floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in that
      floor is person m, then m + n is a perfect square
Person 1 gets room 1 in floor 1 since floor 1 is empty.
Person 2 does not get room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 2 = 3 is not a perfect
square.
Person 2 instead gets room 1 in floor 2 since floor 2 is empty.
Person 3 gets room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 3 = 4 is a perfect square.
Eventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.
Define P(f, r) to be n if person n occupies room r in floor f, and 0 if no
person occupies the room. Here are a few examples:
P(1, 1) = 1
P(1, 2) = 3
P(2, 1) = 2
P(10, 20) = 440
P(25, 75) = 4863
P(99, 100) = 19454
Find the sum of all P(f, r) for all positive f and r such that f ÃƒÂ— r =
71328803586048 and give the last 8 digits as your answer.

rating: 90%
The Thue-Morse sequence {Tn} is a binary sequence satisfying:
    * T0 = 0
    * T2n = Tn
    * T2n+1 = 1 - Tn
The first several terms of {Tn} are given as follows:
01101001100101101001011001101001....
We define {An} as the sorted sequence of integers such that the binary
expression of each element appears as a subsequence in {Tn}.
For example, the decimal number 18 is expressed as 10010 in binary. 10010
appears in {Tn} (T8 to T12), so 18 is an element of {An}.
The decimal number 14 is expressed as 1110 in binary. 1110 never appears in
{Tn}, so 14 is not an element of {An}.
The first several terms of An are given as follows:
                     n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9  10 11 12 Ã¢Â€Â¦

rating: 35%
A cubic BÃƒÂ©zier curve is defined by four points: P0, P1, P2 and P3.
[p363_bezier.png]
The curve is constructed as follows:
On the segments P0P1, P1P2 and P2P3 the points Q0,Q1 and Q2 are drawn such that
P0Q0 / P0P1 = P1Q1 / P1P2 = P2Q2 / P2P3 = t (t in [0,1]).
On the segments Q0Q1 and Q1Q2 the points R0 and R1 are drawn such that
Q0R0 / Q0Q1 = Q1R1 / Q1Q2 = t for the same value of t.
On the segment R0R1 the point B is drawn such that R0B / R0R1 = t for the same
value of t.
The BÃƒÂ©zier curve defined by the points P0, P1, P2, P3 is the locus of B as Q0
takes all possible positions on the segment P0P1.
(Please note that for all points the value of t is the same.)
At this_(external)_web_address you will find an applet that allows you to drag
the points P0, P1, P2 and P3 to see what the BÃƒÂ©zier curve (green curve)
defined by those points looks like. You can also drag the point Q0 along the
segment P0P1.
From the construction it is clear that the BÃƒÂ©zier curve will be tangent to the
segments P0P1 in P0 and P2P3 in P3.
A cubic BÃƒÂ©zier curve with P0=(1,0), P1=(1,v), P2=(v,1) and P3=(0,1) is used to
approximate a quarter circle.
The value v > 0 is chosen such that the area enclosed by the lines OP0, OP3 and
the curve is equal to ÃÂ€/4 (the area of the quarter circle).
By how many percent does the length of the curve differ from the length of the
quarter circle?
That is, if L is the length of the curve, calculate 100 ÃƒÂL Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ ÃÂ€/2
                                                           ÃÂ€/2

rating: 40%
Two players, Anton and Bernhard, are playing the following game.
There is one pile of n stones.
The first player may remove any positive number of stones, but not the whole
pile.
Thereafter, each player may remove at most twice the number of stones his
opponent took on the previous move.
The player who removes the last stone wins.
E.g. n=5
If the first player takes anything more than one stone the next player will be
able to take all remaining stones.
If the first player takes one stone, leaving four, his opponent will take also
one stone, leaving three stones.
The first player cannot take all three because he may take at most 2x1=2
stones. So let's say he takes also one stone, leaving 2. The second player can
take the two remaining stones and wins.
So 5 is a losing position for the first player.
For some winning positions there is more than one possible move for the first
player.
E.g. when n=17 the first player can remove one or four stones.
Let M(n) be the maximum number of stones the first player can take from a
winning position at his first turn and M(n)=0 for any other position.

Bozo sort, not to be confused with the slightly less efficient bogo sort,
consists out of checking if the input sequence is sorted and if not swapping
randomly two elements. This is repeated until eventually the sequence is
sorted.
If we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input the
expectation value of the number of swaps, averaged over all 4! input sequences
is 24.75.
The already sorted sequence takes 0 steps.
In this problem we consider the following variant on bozo sort.
If the sequence is not in order we pick three elements at random and shuffle
these three elements randomly.
All 3!=6 permutations of those three elements are equally likely.
The already sorted sequence will take 0 steps.
If we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input the
expectation value of the number of shuffles, averaged over all 4! input
sequences is 27.5.
Consider as input sequences the permutations of the first 11 natural numbers.
Averaged over all 11! input sequences, what is the expected number of shuffles
this sorting algorithm will perform?

An integer partition of a number n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive

Partitions that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the

part occurs at most once.
The partitions of 5 into distinct parts are:
5, 4+1 and 3+2.
Let f(n) be the maximum product of the parts of any such partition of n into
distinct parts and let m(n) be the number of elements of any such partition of
n with that product.
So f(5)=6 and m(5)=2.
For n=10 the partition with the largest product is 10=2+3+5, which gives f

A game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The
player who rolls the highest value wins.
If the first player picks die A and the second player picks die B we get
P(second player wins) = 7/12 > 1/2
If the first player picks die B and the second player picks die C we get
P(second player wins) = 7/12 > 1/2
If the first player picks die C and the second player picks die A we get
P(second player wins) = 25/36 > 1/2
So whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick another die
and have a larger than 50% chance of winning.
A set of dice having this property is called a nontransitive set of dice.
We wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We will

    * The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll the
      same value neither player wins.
    * The sets of dice {A,B,C}, {B,C,A} and {C,A,B} are the same set.

A Harshad or Niven number is a number that is divisible by the sum of its
digits.
201 is a Harshad number because it is divisible by 3 (the sum of its digits.)
When we truncate the last digit from 201, we get 20, which is a Harshad number.

When we truncate the last digit from 20, we get 2, which is also a Harshad
number.
Let's call a Harshad number that, while recursively truncating the last digit,
always results in a Harshad number a right truncatable Harshad number.
Also:
201/3=67 which is prime.
Let's call a Harshad number that, when divided by the sum of its digits,
results in a prime a strong Harshad number.
Now take the number 2011 which is prime.
When we truncate the last digit from it we get 201, a strong Harshad number
that is also right truncatable.
Let's call such primes strong, right truncatable Harshad primes.
You are given that the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less

Let sk be the number of 1Ã¢Â€Â™s when writing the numbers from 0 to k in binary.
For example, writing 0 to 5 in binary, we have 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101. There
are seven 1Ã¢Â€Â™s, so s5 = 7.
The sequence S = {sk : k Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 0} starts {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, ...}.
A game is played by two players. Before the game starts, a number n is chosen.
A counter c starts at 0. At each turn, the player chooses a number from 1 to n
(inclusive) and increases c by that number. The resulting value of c must be a
member of S. If there are no more valid moves, the player loses.
For example:
Let n = 5. c starts at 0.
Player 1 chooses 4, so c becomes 0 + 4 = 4.
Player 2 chooses 5, so c becomes 4 + 5 = 9.
Player 1 chooses 3, so c becomes 9 + 3 = 12.
etc.
Note that c must always belong to S, and each player can increase c by at most
n.
Let M(n) be the highest number the first player can choose at her first turn to
force a win, and M(n) = 0 if there is no such move. For example, M(2) = 2, M(7)

While there is at least a given fraction F of pie left, he performs the

- He makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what is remaining of
the pie border, any point on the remaining pie border equally likely. This will
divide the remaining pie into three pieces.
- Going counterclockwise from the initial cut, he takes the first two pie
pieces and eats them.
When less than a fraction F of pie remains, he does not repeat this procedure.
Instead, he eats all of the remaining pie.

For any positive integer n, the nth weak Goodstein sequence {g1, g2, g3, ...}

    * g1 = n
    * for k > 1, gk is obtained by writing gk-1 in base k, interpreting it as a

The sequence terminates when gk becomes 0.
For example, the 6th weak Goodstein sequence is {6, 11, 17, 25, ...}:
    * g1 = 6.
    * g2 = 11 since 6 = 1102, 1103 = 12, and 12 - 1 = 11.
    * g3 = 17 since 11 = 1023, 1024 = 18, and 18 - 1 = 17.
    * g4 = 25 since 17 = 1014, 1015 = 26, and 26 - 1 = 25.

***** Guessing Game *****
**** Problem 406 ****
Published on Sunday, 16th December 2012, 07:00 am; Solved by 239; Difficulty
rating: 50%
We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2,
..., n} by asking questions. Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three
possible answers:
    * "Your guess is lower than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of a),
      or
    * "Your guess is higher than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of
      b), or
    * "Yes, that's it!" (and the game ends).
Given the value of n, a, and b, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost
for_the_worst_possible_case.
For example, if n = 5, a = 2, and b = 3, then we may begin by asking "2" as our
first question.
If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3),
then we are sure that "1" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 3).
If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then
our next question will be "4".
If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3),
then we are sure that "3" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=5).
If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then
we are sure that "5" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=4).
Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is 5. It can also be shown
that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. So, in fact, we
have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of n, a, and b.
Let C(n, a, b) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the
given values of n, a, and b.
Here are a few examples:
C(5, 2, 3) = 5
C(500, Ã¢ÂˆÂš2, Ã¢ÂˆÂš3) = 13.22073197...
C(20000, 5, 7) = 82
C(2000000, Ã¢ÂˆÂš5, Ã¢ÂˆÂš7) = 49.63755955...
Let Fk be the Fibonacci numbers: Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 with base cases F1 = F2 = 1.
Find Ã¢ÂˆÂ‘1Ã¢Â‰Â¤kÃ¢Â‰Â¤30Ã‚Â C(1012, Ã¢ÂˆÂšk, Ã¢ÂˆÂšFk), and give your answer rounded to 8

***** Kaprekar constant *****
**** Problem 414 ****
Published on Sunday, 10th February 2013, 07:00 am; Solved by 182; Difficulty
rating: 60%
6174 is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order and
subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the digits in
decreasing order, we get 7641-1467=6174.
Even more remarkable is that if we start from any 4 digit number and repeat
this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up with 6174 or
immediately with 0 if all digits are equal.
This also works with numbers that have less than 4 digits if we pad the number
with leading zeroes until we have 4 digits.
E.g. let's start with the number 0837:
8730-0378=8352
8532-2358=6174
6174 is called the Kaprekar constant. The process of sorting and subtracting
and repeating this until either 0 or the Kaprekar constant is reached is called
the Kaprekar routine.
We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits.
Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all cases;
either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or the constant
the routine arrives at can be different for different input numbers.
However, it can be shown that for 5 digits and a base b = 6t+3Ã¢Â‰Â 9, a Kaprekar
constant exists.
E.g. base 15: (10,4,14,9,5)15
base 21: (14,6,20,13,7)21
Define Cb to be the Kaprekar constant in base b for 5 digits. Define the
function sb(i) to be
    * 0 if i = Cb or if i written in base b consists of 5 identical digits
    * the number of iterations it takes the Kaprekar routine in base b to
      arrive at Cb, otherwise
Note that we can define sb(i) for all integers i < b5. If i written in base b
takes less than 5 digits, the number is padded with leading zero digits until
we have 5 digits before applying the Kaprekar routine.
Define S(b) as the sum of sb(i) for 0 < i < b5.
E.g. S(15) = 5274369
S(111) = 400668930299
Find the sum of S(6k+3) for 2 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ k Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 300.

A set of lattice points S is called a titanic set if there exists a line
passing through exactly two points in S.
An example of a titanic set is S = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (1,
0)}, where the line passing through (0, 1) and (2, 0) does not pass through any
other point in S.
On the other hand, the set {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)} is not a titanic
set since the line passing through any two points in the set also passes
through the other two.
For any positive integer N, let T(N) be the number of titanic sets S whose
every point (x, y) satisfies 0 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ x, y Ã¢Â‰Â¤ N. It can be verified that T(1) =

example which is coded as follows:
6,X,X,(vCC),(vI),X,X,X,(hH),B,O,(vCA),(vJE),X,(hFE,vD),O,O,O,O,(hA),O,I,
(hJC,vB),O,O,(hJC),H,O,O,O,X,X,X,(hJE),O,O,X
The first character is a numerical digit indicating the size of the information
grid. It would be either a 6 (for a 5x5 kakuro puzzle) or a 7 (for a 6x6
puzzle) followed by a comma (,). The extra top line and left column are needed
to insert information.
The content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma, going left
to right and starting with the top line.
X = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.
O (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.
A = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by its
equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.
( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a lower
case "h" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case "v". Those are followed
by one or two upper case letters depending if the sum is a single digit or
double digit one. For double digit sums, the first letter would be for the
"tens" and the second one for the "units". When the cell must contain
information for both a horizontal and a vertical sum, the first one is always
for the horizontal sum and the two are separated by a comma within the same set
of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets is also immediately followed
by a comma.
The description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line Feed
(CRLF) instead of a comma.
The required answer to each puzzle is based on the value of each letter
necessary to arrive at the solution and according to the alphabetical order. As
indicated under the example puzzle, its answer would be 8426039571. At least 9
out of the 10 encrypting letters are always part of the problem description.
When only 9 are given, the missing one must be assigned the remaining digit.

***** Box-ball system *****
**** Problem 426 ****
Published on Saturday, 4th May 2013, 07:00 pm; Solved by 167; Difficulty
rating: 75%
Consider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For
example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed by 2
empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can be denoted
by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of consecutive occupied
and empty boxes appear alternately.
A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the following
rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the nearest empty
box to its right.
After one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can be
seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first occupied
box.
                              [p426_baxball1.gif]
A system like this is called a Box-Ball System or BBS for short.
It can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system evolves to
a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is invariant. In the
example below, the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes evolves to [1, 2, 3];
we shall call this the final state.
                              [p426_baxball2.gif]
We define the sequence {ti}:
    * s0 = 290797
    * sk+1 = sk2 mod 50515093
    * tk = (sk mod 64) + 1
Starting from the initial configuration (t0, t1, Ã¢Â€Â¦, t10), the final state
becomes [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].
Starting from the initial configuration (t0, t1, Ã¢Â€Â¦, t10 000 000), find the
final state.
Give as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final state.
For example, if the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 12 + 22 + 32) is your
answer.

A sequence of integers S = {si} is called an n-sequence if it has n elements
and each element si satisfies 1 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ si Ã¢Â‰Â¤ n. Thus there are nn distinct n-
sequences in total. For example, the sequence S = {1, 5, 5, 10, 7, 7, 7, 2, 3,
7} is a 10-sequence.
For any sequence S, let L(S) be the length of the longest contiguous
subsequence of S with the same value. For example, for the given sequence S
above, L(S) = 3, because of the three consecutive 7's.
Let f(n) = Ã¢ÂˆÂ‘ L(S) for all n-sequences S.
For example, f(3) = 45, f(7) = 1403689 and f(11) = 481496895121.

***** Square Space Silo *****
**** Problem 431 ****
Published on Sunday, 9th June 2013, 10:00 am; Solved by 375; Difficulty rating:
40%
Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm and
having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated when he
discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from the company
that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos,
but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and
insists that it is removed from his property.
Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from
above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal
is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, $\alpha =
30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect
cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which
has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately
32.648388556 m3. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has
a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a
strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.
[p431_grain_silo.png]
We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by $V(x)$. If
$x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the
amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \approx 36$. Given the range of
possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: $V
(2.511167869) \approx 49$. It would be like knowing that the square is king of
the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.
Fred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer
inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to
despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the
silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain
is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this
particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.
If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's
appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all
possible square space wastage options and calculate $\sum x$ correct to 9
decimal places.

rating: 75%
Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the
vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.
Graphs can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex with a
point in the Euclidean space.
A flexible graph is an embedding of a graph where it is possible to move one or
more vertices continuously so that the distance between at least two
nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between each pair of
adjacent vertices is kept constant.
A rigid graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.
Informally, a graph is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully rotating
hinges and the edges with rods that are unbending and inelastic, no parts of
the graph can be moved independently from the rest of the graph.
The grid graphs embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as the following
animation demonstrates:
[p434_rigid.gif]
However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the cells. For
example, for the 2x3 grid graph, there are 19 ways to make the graph rigid:
[p434_rigid23.png]
Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing the
orientation of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a cell as a
different way of making a grid graph rigid.
Let R(m,n) be the number of ways to make the m ÃƒÂ— n grid graph rigid.

When we calculate 8n modulo 11 for n=0 to 9 we get: 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2, 5,
7.
As we see all possible values from 1 to 10 occur. So 8 is a primitive root of
11.
But there is more:
If we take a closer look we see:
1+8=9
8+9=17Ã¢Â‰Â¡6 mod 11
9+6=15Ã¢Â‰Â¡4 mod 11
6+4=10
4+10=14Ã¢Â‰Â¡3 mod 11
10+3=13Ã¢Â‰Â¡2 mod 11
3+2=5
2+5=7
5+7=12Ã¢Â‰Â¡1 mod 11.
So the powers of 8 mod 11 are cyclic with period 10, and 8n + 8n+1 Ã¢Â‰Â¡ 8n+2
(mod 11).
8 is called a Fibonacci primitive root of 11.
Not every prime has a Fibonacci primitive root.

A hypocycloid is the curve drawn by a point on a small circle rolling inside a
larger circle. The parametric equations of a hypocycloid centered at the
origin, and starting at the right most point is given by:
$x(t) = (R - r) \cos(t) + r \cos(\frac {R - r} r t)$
$y(t) = (R - r) \sin(t) - r \sin(\frac {R - r} r t)$
Where R is the radius of the large circle and r the radius of the small circle.
Let $C(R, r)$ be the set of distinct points with integer coordinates on the
hypocycloid with radius R and r and for which there is a corresponding value of
t such that $\sin(t)$ and $\cos(t)$ are rational numbers.
Let $S(R, r) = \sum_{(x,y) \in C(R, r)} |x| + |y|$ be the sum of the absolute
values of the x and y coordinates of the points in $C(R, r)$.

***** An ant on the move *****
**** Problem 460 ****
Published on Saturday, 22nd February 2014, 01:00 pm; Solved by 218; Difficulty
rating: 55%
On the Euclidean plane, an ant travels from point A(0, 1) to point B(d, 1) for
an integer d.
In each step, the ant at point (x0, y0) chooses one of the lattice points (x1,
y1) which satisfy x1 Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 0 and y1 Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 1 and goes straight to (x1, y1) at a
constant velocity v. The value of v depends on y0 and y1 as follows:
    * If y0 = y1, the value of v equals y0.
    * If y0 Ã¢Â‰Â  y1, the value of v equals (y1 - y0) / (ln(y1) - ln(y0)).
The left image is one of the possible paths for d = 4. First the ant goes from
A(0, 1) to P1(1, 3) at velocity (3 - 1) / (ln(3) - ln(1)) Ã¢Â‰Âˆ 1.8205. Then the
required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 Ã¢Â‰Âˆ 1.2283.
From P1(1, 3) to P2(3, 3) the ant travels at velocity 3 so the required time is
2 / 3 Ã¢Â‰Âˆ 0.6667. From P2(3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant travels at velocity (1 - 3)
/ (ln(1) - ln(3)) Ã¢Â‰Âˆ 1.8205 so the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 Ã¢Â‰Âˆ
1.2283.
Thus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.
The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as
0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052. It can be shown that this is the quickest path
for d = 4.
                                [p460_ant.jpg]
Let F(d) be the total required time if the ant chooses the quickest path. For
example, F(4) Ã¢Â‰Âˆ 2.960516287.
We can verify that F(10) Ã¢Â‰Âˆ 4.668187834 and F(100) Ã¢Â‰Âˆ 9.217221972.

This is one of the possible permutations for N = 20.

rating: 85%
The kernel of a polygon is defined by the set of points from which the entire
polygon's boundary is visible. We define a polar polygon as a polygon for which
the origin is strictly contained inside its kernel.
For this problem, a polygon can have collinear consecutive vertices. However, a
polygon still cannot have self-intersection and cannot have zero area.
For example, only the first of the following is a polar polygon (the kernels of
the second, third, and fourth do not strictly contain the origin, and the fifth
does not have a kernel at all):
                              [p465_polygons.png]
Notice that the first polygon has three consecutive collinear vertices.
Let P(n) be the number of polar polygons such that the vertices (x, y) have
integer coordinates whose absolute values are not greater than n.
Note that polygons should be counted as different if they have different set of
edges, even if they enclose the same area. For example, the polygon with
vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0)] is distinct from the polygon with vertices [
(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0),(1,0)].
For example, P(1) = 131, P(2) = 1648531, P(3) = 1099461296175 and P(343) mod

An integer is called B-smooth if none of its prime factors is greater than B.
Let SB(n) be the largest B-smooth divisor of n.
Examples:
S1(10) = 1
S4(2100) = 12
S17(2496144) = 5712
Define F(n) = Ã¢ÂˆÂ‘1Ã¢Â‰Â¤BÃ¢Â‰Â¤n Ã¢ÂˆÂ‘0Ã¢Â‰Â¤rÃ¢Â‰Â¤n SB(C(n,r)). Here, C(n,r) denotes the
binomial coefficient.
Examples:
F(11) = 3132
F(1Ã‚Â 111) mod 1Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â 993 = 706036312
F(111Ã‚Â 111) mod 1Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â 993 = 22156169
Find F(11Ã‚Â 111Ã‚Â 111) mod 1Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â 993.

***** Super Ramvok *****
**** Problem 470 ****
Published on Saturday, 3rd May 2014, 07:00 pm; Solved by 133; Difficulty
rating: 65%
Consider a single game of Ramvok:
Let t represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If t = 0, then the
game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn i, the player rolls a die. After
rolling, if i < t the player can either stop the game and receive a prize equal
to the value of the current roll, or discard the roll and try again next turn.
If i = t, then the roll cannot be discarded and the prize must be accepted.
Before the game begins, t is chosen by the player, who must then pay an up-
front cost ct for some constant c. For c = 0, t can be chosen to be infinite
(with an up-front cost of 0). Let R(d, c) be the expected profit (i.e. net
gain) that the player receives from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok,
given a fair d-sided die and cost constant c. For example, R(4, 0.2) = 2.65.
Assume that the player has sufficient funds for paying any/all up-front costs.
Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:
In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a slight
modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration process is as
follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face has its pips
visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If the face is already
blank, then it is changed back to its original value. After the alteration is
made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during such a game, at each turn,
the die is rolled until a face with a value on it appears). The player knows
which faces are blank and which are not at all times. The game of Super Ramvok
ends once all faces of the die are blank.
Let S(d, c) be the expected profit that the player receives from an optimally-
played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die to start (with all sides
visible), and cost constant c. For example, S(6, 1) = 208.3.
Let F(n) = Ã¢ÂˆÂ‘4Ã¢Â‰Â¤dÃ¢Â‰Â¤n Ã¢ÂˆÂ‘0Ã¢Â‰Â¤cÃ¢Â‰Â¤n S(d, c).
Calculate F(20), rounded to the nearest integer.

There are N seats in a row. N people come one after another to fill the seats
according to the following rules:
   1. No person sits beside another.
   2. The first person chooses any seat.
   3. Each subsequent person chooses the seat furthest from anyone else already
      seated, as long as it does not violate rule 1. If there is more than one
      choice satisfying this condition, then the person chooses the leftmost
      choice.
Note that due to rule 1, some seats will surely be left unoccupied, and the
maximum number of people that can be seated is less than N (for N > 1).
Here are the possible seating arrangements for N = 15:
                                [p472_n15.png]
We see that if the first person chooses correctly, the 15 seats can seat up to
7 people.
We can also see that the first person has 9 choices to maximize the number of
people that may be seated.

***** Phigital number base *****
**** Problem 473 ****
Published on Sunday, 25th May 2014, 04:00 am; Solved by 438; Difficulty rating:
35%
Let $\varphi$ be the golden ratio: $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.$
Remarkably it is possible to write every positive integer as a sum of powers of
$\varphi$ even if we require that every power of $\varphi$ is used at most once
in this sum.
Even then this representation is not unique.
We can make it unique by requiring that no powers with consecutive exponents
are used and that the representation is finite.
E.g: $2=\varphi+\varphi^{-2}$ and $3=\varphi^{2}+\varphi^{-2}$
To represent this sum of powers of $\varphi$ we use a string of 0's and 1's
with a point to indicate where the negative exponents start.
We call this the representation in the phigital numberbase.
So $1=1_{\varphi}$, $2=10.01_{\varphi}$, $3=100.01_{\varphi}$ and
$14=100100.001001_{\varphi}$.
The strings representing 1, 2 and 14 in the phigital number base are
palindromic, while the string representing 3 is not.
(the phigital point is not the middle character).
The sum of the positive integers not exceeding 1000 whose phigital
representation is palindromic is 4345.
Find the sum of the positive integers not exceeding $10^{10}$ whose phigital
representation is palindromic.

The number sequence game starts with a sequence S of N numbers written on a
line.
Two players alternate turns. At his turn, a player must select and remove
either the first or the last number remaining in the sequence.
The player score is the sum of all the numbers he has taken. Each player
attempts to maximize his own sum.
If N = 4 and S = {1, 2, 10, 3}, then each player maximizes his score as
follows:
    * Player 1: removes the first number (1)
    * Player 2: removes the last number from the remaining sequence (3)
    * Player 1: removes the last number from the remaining sequence (10)

***** Mixtures *****
**** Problem 478 ****
Published on Saturday, 30th August 2014, 07:00 pm; Solved by 111; Difficulty
rating: 100%
Let us consider mixtures of three substances: A, B and C. A mixture can be
described by a ratio of the amounts of A, B, and C in it, i.e., (aÃ‚Â :Ã‚Â bÃ‚Â :
Ã‚Â c). For example, a mixture described by the ratio (2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 3Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 5) contains
20% A, 30% B and 50% C.
For the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components
from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures
to form mixtures with new ratios.
For example, say we have three mixtures with ratios (3Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 0Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 2), (3Ã‚Â :
Ã‚Â 6Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 11) and (3Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 3Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 4). By mixing 10 units of the first, 20 units of
the second and 30 units of the third, we get a new mixture with ratio (6Ã‚Â :
Ã‚Â 5Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 9), since:
(10Ã‚Â·3/5Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 20Ã‚Â·3/20Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 30Ã‚Â·3/10Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 10Ã‚Â·0/5Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 20Ã‚Â·6/20Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 30Ã‚Â·3/10Ã‚Â :
Ã‚Â 10Ã‚Â·2/5Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 20Ã‚Â·11/20Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 30Ã‚Â·4/10) = (18Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 15Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 27) = (6Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 5Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 9)
However, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the ratio (3Ã‚Â :
Ã‚Â 2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1), since the amount of B is always less than the amount of C.
Let n be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of integers (a, b,
c) with 0 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ a, b, c Ã¢Â‰Â¤ n and gcd(a, b, c) = 1, we have a mixture with ratio
(aÃ‚Â :Ã‚Â bÃ‚Â :Ã‚Â c). Let M(n) be the set of all such mixtures.
For example, M(2) contains the 19 mixtures with the following ratios:
{(0Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 0Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1), (0Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 0), (0Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1), (0Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 2), (0Ã‚Â :
Ã‚Â 2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1),
(1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 0Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 0), (1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 0Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1), (1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 0Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 2), (1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 0), (1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1Ã‚Â :
Ã‚Â 1),
(1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 2), (1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 0), (1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1), (1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 2), (2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 0Ã‚Â :
Ã‚Â 1),
(2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 0), (2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1), (2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 2), (2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 2Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â 1)}.
Let E(n) be the number of subsets of M(n) which can produce the mixture with
ratio (1 : 1 : 1), i.e., the mixture with equal parts A, B and C.
We can verify that E(1) = 103, E(2) = 520447, E(10)Ã‚Â modÃ‚Â 118 = 82608406 and E
(500)Ã‚Â modÃ‚Â 118 = 13801403.

rating: 65%
A group of chefs (numbered #1, #2, etc) participate in a turn-based strategic
cooking competition. On each chef's turn, he/she cooks up a dish to the best of
his/her ability and gives it to a separate panel of judges for taste-testing.
Let S(k) represent chef #k's skill level (which is publicly known). More
specifically, S(k) is the probability that chef #k's dish will be assessed
favorably by the judges (on any/all turns). If the dish receives a favorable
rating, then the chef must choose one other chef to be eliminated from the
competition. The last chef remaining in the competition is the winner.
The game always begins with chef #1, with the turn order iterating sequentially
over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle repeats from the
lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their chances of winning within
the rules as stated, assuming that the other chefs behave in the same manner.
In the event that a chef has more than one equally-optimal elimination choice,
assume that the chosen chef is always the one with the next-closest turn.
Define Wn(k) as the probability that chef #k wins in a competition with n
chefs. If we have S(1) = 0.25, S(2) = 0.5, and S(3) = 1, then W3(1) = 0.29375.
Going forward, we assign S(k) = Fk/Fn+1 over all 1 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ k Ã¢Â‰Â¤ n, where Fk is a
Fibonacci number: Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 with base cases F1 = F2 = 1. Then, for
example, when considering a competition with n = 7 chefs, we have W7(1) =
0.08965042, W7(2) = 0.20775702, W7(3) = 0.15291406, W7(4) = 0.14554098, W7(5) =
0.15905291, W7(6) = 0.10261412, and W7(7) = 0.14247050, rounded to 8 decimal
places each.
Let E(n) represent the expected number of dishes cooked in a competition with n

We define a permutation as an operation that rearranges the order of the
elements {1, 2, 3, ..., n}. There are n! such permutations, one of which leaves
the elements in their initial order. For n = 3 we have 3! = 6 permutations:
- P1 = keep the initial order
- P2 = exchange the 1st and 2nd elements
- P3 = exchange the 1st and 3rd elements
- P4 = exchange the 2nd and 3rd elements
- P5 = rotate the elements to the right
- P6 = rotate the elements to the left
If we select one of these permutations, and we re-apply the same permutation
repeatedly, we eventually restore the initial order.
For a permutation Pi, let f(Pi) be the number of steps required to restore the
initial order by applying the permutation Pi repeatedly.
For n = 3, we obtain:
- f(P1) = 1 : (1,2,3) Ã¢Â†Â’ (1,2,3)
- f(P2) = 2 : (1,2,3) Ã¢Â†Â’ (2,1,3) Ã¢Â†Â’ (1,2,3)
- f(P3) = 2 : (1,2,3) Ã¢Â†Â’ (3,2,1) Ã¢Â†Â’ (1,2,3)
- f(P4) = 2 : (1,2,3) Ã¢Â†Â’ (1,3,2) Ã¢Â†Â’ (1,2,3)
- f(P5) = 3 : (1,2,3) Ã¢Â†Â’ (3,1,2) Ã¢Â†Â’ (2,3,1) Ã¢Â†Â’ (1,2,3)
- f(P6) = 3 : (1,2,3) Ã¢Â†Â’ (2,3,1) Ã¢Â†Â’ (3,1,2) Ã¢Â†Â’ (1,2,3)
Let g(n) be the average value of f2(Pi) over all permutations Pi of length n.

***** Unbalanced Nim *****

rating: 80%
Alice and Bob have enjoyed playing Nim every day. However, they finally got
bored of playing ordinary three-heap Nim.
So, they added an extra rule:
- Must not make two heaps of the same size.
The triple (a,b,c) indicates the size of three heaps.
Under this extra rule, (2,4,5) is one of the losing positions for the next
player.
To illustrate:
- Alice moves to (2,4,3)
- Bob moves to (0,4,3)
- Alice moves to (0,2,3)
- Bob moves to (0,2,1)
Unlike ordinary three-heap Nim, (0,1,2) and its permutations are the end states
of this game.
For an integer N, we define F(N) as the sum of a+b+c for all the losing
positions for the next player, with 0 < a < b < c < N.
For example, F(8) = 42, because there are 4 losing positions for the next
player, (1,3,5), (1,4,6), (2,3,6) and (2,4,5).
We can also verify that F(128) = 496062.

\atop 3 a_i+1} {\text{if }a_i\text{ is even} \atop \text{if }a_i\text{ is odd}}
\right.$.
The Collatz conjecture states that starting from any positive integer, the
sequence eventually reaches the cycle 1,4,2,1....
We shall define the sequence prefix p(n) for the Collatz sequence starting with
a1 = n as the sub-sequence of all numbers not a power of 2 (20=1 is considered
a power of 2 for this problem). For example:
p(13) = {13, 40, 20, 10, 5}
p(8) = {}
Any number invalidating the conjecture would have an infinite length sequence
prefix.
Let Sm be the set of all sequence prefixes of length m. Two sequences {a1, a2,
..., am} and {b1, b2, ..., bm} in Sm are said to belong to the same prefix
family if ai < aj if and only if bi < bj for all 1 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ i,j Ã¢Â‰Â¤m.
For example, in S4, {6, 3, 10, 5} is in the same family as {454, 227, 682,
341}, but not {113, 340, 170, 85}.

Bob is very familiar with the famous mathematical puzzle/game, "Tower of
Hanoi," which consists of three upright rods and disks of different sizes that
can slide onto any of the rods. The game begins with a stack of n disks placed
on the leftmost rod in descending order by size. The objective of the game is
to move all of the disks from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod, given the
following restrictions:
   1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
   2. A valid move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing
      it onto another stack (or an empty rod).
   3. No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.
Moving on to a variant of this game, consider a long room k units (square
tiles) wide, labeled from 1 to k in ascending order. Three rods are placed at
squares a, b, and c, and a stack of n disks is placed on the rod at square a.
Bob begins the game standing at square b. His objective is to play the Tower of
Hanoi game by moving all of the disks to the rod at square c. However, Bob can
only pick up or set down a disk if he is on the same square as the rod / stack
in question.
Unfortunately, Bob is also drunk. On a given move, Bob will either stumble one
square to the left or one square to the right with equal probability, unless
Bob is at either end of the room, in which case he can only move in one
direction. Despite Bob's inebriated state, he is still capable of following the
rules of the game itself, as well as choosing when to pick up or put down a
disk.
The following animation depicts a side-view of a sample game for n = 3, k = 7,
a = 2, b = 4, and c = 6:
                               [p497_hanoi.gif]
Let E(n,k,a,b,c) be the expected number of squares that Bob travels during a
single optimally-played game. A game is played optimally if the number of disk-
pickups is minimized.
Interestingly enough, the result is always an integer. For example, E
(2,5,1,3,5) = 60 and E(3,20,4,9,17) = 2358.

Consider the Gaussian integer i-1. A base i-1 representation of a Gaussian
integer a+bi is a finite sequence of digits dn-1dn-2...d1d0 such that:
    * a+bi = dn-1(i-1)n-1 + dn-2(i-1)n-2 + ... + d1(i-1) + d0
    * Each dk is in {0,1}
    * There are no leading zeroes, i.e. dn-1 Ã¢Â‰Â  0, unless a+bi is itself 0
Here are base i-1 representations of a few Gaussian integers:

11+24i Ã¢Â†Â’ 111010110001101
24-11i Ã¢Â†Â’ 110010110011
8+0i Ã¢Â†Â’ 111000000
-5+0i Ã¢Â†Â’ 11001101
0+0i Ã¢Â†Â’ 0
Remarkably, every Gaussian integer has a unique base i-1 representation!

Define f(a+bi) as the number of 1s in the unique base i-1 representation of
a+bi. For example, f(11+24i) = 9 and f(24-11i) = 7.

Define B(L) as the sum of f(a+bi) for all integers a, b such that |a| Ã¢Â‰Â¤ L and
|b| Ã¢Â‰Â¤ L. For example, B(500) = 10795060.

Anton and Bertrand love to play three pile Nim.
However, after a lot of games of Nim they got bored and changed the rules
somewhat.
They may only take a number of stones from a pile that is a proper divisor of
the number of stones present in the pile.
E.g. if a pile at a certain moment contains 24 stones they may take only
1,2,3,4,6,8 or 12 stones from that pile.
So if a pile contains one stone they can't take the last stone from it as 1
isn't a proper divisor of 1.
The first player that can't make a valid move loses the game.
Of course both Anton and Bertrand play optimally.
The triple (a,b,c) indicates the number of stones in the three piles.
Let S(n) be the number of winning positions for the next player for 1 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ a, b,
c Ã¢Â‰Â¤ n.

A geoboard (of order N) is a square board with equally-spaced pins protruding
from the surface, representing an integer point lattice for coordinates 0 Ã¢Â‰Â¤
x,y Ã¢Â‰Â¤ N.
John begins with a pinless geoboard. Each position on the board is a hole that
can be filled with a pin. John decides to generate a random integer between 1
and N+1 (inclusive) for each hole in the geoboard. If the random integer is
equal to 1 for a given hole, then a pin is placed in that hole.
After John is finished generating numbers for all (N+1)2 holes and placing any/
all corresponding pins, he wraps a tight rubberband around the entire group of
pins protruding from the board. Let S represent the shape that is formed. S can
also be defined as the smallest convex shape that contains all the pins.

***** Hilbert's Blackout *****
**** Problem 522 ****
Published on Sunday, 28th June 2015, 04:00 am; Solved by 145; Difficulty
rating: 85%
Despite the popularity of Hilbert's infinite hotel, Hilbert decided to try
managing extremely large finite hotels, instead.
To cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special
generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top
floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have
the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and
have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.
Unfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built
the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor
at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator
placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.
For example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:
                         [p522_hilberts_blackout.png]
If the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive
power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there
would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can
receive power from many other floors at once, it can only send power to one
other floor.
To resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of
floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In
the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the
second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.
Let F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all
possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of n floors. For example, F(3) = 6,
F(8) = 16276736, and F(100) mod 135707531 = 84326147.
Find F(12344321) mod 135707531.

***** Randomized Binary Search *****

rating: 30%
A secret integer t is selected at random within the range 1 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ t Ã¢Â‰Â¤ n.
The goal is to guess the value of t by making repeated guesses, via integer g.
After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be
revealed that either g < t, g = t, or g > t. Then the process can repeat as
necessary.
Normally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a
binary search: Given a lower bound L and upper bound H (initialized to L = 1
and H = n), let g = Ã¢ÂŒÂŠ(L+H)/2Ã¢ÂŒÂ‹ where Ã¢ÂŒÂŠÃ¢Â‹Â…Ã¢ÂŒÂ‹ is the integer floor
function. If g = t, the process ends. Otherwise, if g < t, set L = g+1, but if
g > t instead, set H = gÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1. After setting the new bounds, the search process
repeats, and ultimately ends once t is found. Even if t can be deduced without
searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.
Your friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much
better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting g = Ã¢ÂŒÂŠ(L+H)/2Ã¢ÂŒÂ‹,

***** Nanobots on Geodesics *****

rating: 55%
Bob is a manufacturer of nanobots and wants to impress his customers by giving
them a ball colored by his new nanobots as a present.
His nanobots can be programmed to select and locate exactly one other bot
precisely and, after activation, move towards this bot along the shortest
possible path and draw a colored line onto the surface while moving. Placed on
a plane, the bots will start to move towards their selected bots in a straight
line. In contrast, being placed on a ball, they will start to move along a
geodesic as the shortest possible path. However, in both cases, whenever their
target moves they will adjust their direction instantaneously to the new
shortest possible path. All bots will move at the same speed after their
simultaneous activation until each bot reaches its goal.
Now Bob places n bots on the ball (with radius 1) equidistantly on a small
circle with radius 0.999 and programs each of them to move toward the next
nanobot sitting counterclockwise on that small circle. After activation, the
bots move in a sort of spiral until they finally meet at one point on the ball.
Using three bots, Bob finds that every bot will draw a line of length 2.84,
resulting in a total length of 8.52 for all three bots, each time rounded to
two decimal places. The colored ball looks like this:
                              [p532-nanobots.jpg]

bots to make sure that the line each bot draws is longer than 1000. What is the
total length of all lines drawn with this number of bots, rounded to two
decimal places?

***** Weak Queens *****

The classical eight queens puzzle is the well known problem of placing eight
chess queens on a 8ÃƒÂ—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
Allowing configurations to reappear in rotated or mirrored form, a total of 92
distinct configurations can be found for eight queens. The general case asks
for the number of distinct ways of placing n queens on a nÃƒÂ—n board, e.g. you
can find 2 distinct configurations for n=4.
Lets define a weak queen on a nÃƒÂ—n board to be a piece which can move any
number of squares if moved horizontally, but a maximum of nÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1Ã¢ÂˆÂ’w squares if
moved vertically or diagonally, 0Ã¢Â‰Â¤w<n being the "weakness factor". For
example, a weak queen on a nÃƒÂ—n board with a weakness factor of w=1 located in
the bottom row will not be able to threaten any square in the top row as the
weak queen would need to move nÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1 squares vertically or diagonally to get
there, but may only move nÃ¢ÂˆÂ’2 squares in these directions. In contrast, the
weak queen is not handicapped horizontally, thus threatening every square in
its own row, independently from its current position in that row.
Let Q(n,w) be the number of ways n weak queens with weakness factor w can be
placed on a nÃƒÂ—n board so that no two queens threaten each other. It can be
shown, for example, that Q(4,0)=2, Q(4,2)=16 and Q(4,3)=256.
Let $S(n)=\displaystyle\sum_{w=0}^{n-1} Q(n,w)$.
You are given that S(4)=276 and S(5)=3347.

are 4 elements (si, sj, sk, sl) of S (all i, j, k, l distinct). If there are
many quadrilaterals with the same maximum area, then choose the one with the
largest perimeter.
For example, if SÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â (8,Ã‚Â 9,Ã‚Â 14,Ã‚Â 9,Ã‚Â 27), then we can take the elements
(9,Ã‚Â 14,Ã‚Â 9,Ã‚Â 27) and form an isosceles trapezium with parallel side lengths 14
and 27 and both leg lengths 9. The area of this quadrilateral is
127.611470879... It can be shown that this is the largest area for any
quadrilateral that can be formed using side lengths from S. Therefore, f

consisting of x ÃƒÂ— y unit squares (1 Ã¢Â‰Â¤ x,y Ã¢Â‰Â¤ n - 2) within the original
square has been removed.

***** Chinese leftovers II *****
**** Problem 552 ****
Published on Saturday, 19th March 2016, 07:00 pm; Solved by 184
Let An be the smallest positive integer satisfying An mod pi = i for all 1 Ã¢Â‰Â¤
i Ã¢Â‰Â¤ n, where pi is the i-th prime.
For example A2 = 5, since this is the smallest positive solution of the system
of equations
    * A2 mod 2 = 1
    * A2 mod 3 = 2
The system of equations for A3 adds another constraint. That is, A3 is the
smallest positive solution of
    * A3 mod 2 = 1
    * A3 mod 3 = 2
    * A3 mod 5 = 3
and hence A3 = 23. Similarly, one gets A4 = 53 and A5 = 1523.
Let S(n) be the sum of all primes up to n that divide at least one element in
the sequence A.
For example, S(50) = 69 = 5 + 23 + 41, since 5 divides A2, 23 divides A3 and 41
divides A10 = 5765999453. No other prime number up to 50 divides an element in
A.
Find S(300000).

Let R(n) be the set of all the non-empty subsets of Q(n).
An element XÃ‚Â Ã¢ÂˆÂˆÃ‚Â R(n) is a non-empty subset of Q(n), so it is itself a set.

***** McCarthy 91 function *****
**** Problem 555 ****
Published on Sunday, 10th April 2016, 04:00 am; Solved by 224
The McCarthy 91 function is defined as follows: $$ M_{91}(n) = \begin{cases} n
- 10 & \text{if } n > 100 \\ M_{91}(M_{91}(n+11)) & \text{if } 0 \leq n \leq
100 \end{cases} $$
We can generalize this definition by abstracting away the constants into new
variables: $$ M_{m,k,s}(n) = \begin{cases} n - s & \text{if } n > m \\ M_
{m,k,s}(M_{m,k,s}(n+k)) & \text{if } 0 \leq n \leq m \end{cases} $$
This way, we have $M_{91} = M_{100,11,10}$.
Let $F_{m,k,s}$ be the set of fixed points of $M_{m,k,s}$. That is, $$F_
{m,k,s}= \left\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \, | \, M_{m,k,s}(n) = n \right\}$$
For example, the only fixed point of $M_{91}$ is $n = 91$. In other words, $F_
{100,11,10}= \{91\}$.
Now, define $SF(m,k,s)$ as the sum of the elements in $F_{m,k,s}$ and let $S
(p,m) = \displaystyle \sum_{1 \leq s < k \leq p}{SF(m,k,s)}$.
For example, $S(10, 10) = 225$ and $S(1000, 1000)=208724467$.
Find $S(10^6, 10^6)$.



***** Squarefree Gaussian Integers *****
**** Problem 556 ****
Published on Sunday, 17th April 2016, 07:00 am; Solved by 80
A Gaussian integer is a number zÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â aÃ‚Â +Ã‚Â bi where a, b are integers and
i2Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -1.
Gaussian integers are a subset of the complex numbers, and the integers are the
subset of Gaussian integers for which bÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.
A Gaussian integer unit is one for which a2Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â b2Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1, i.e. one of 1, i, -1,
-i.
Let's define a proper Gaussian integer as one for which aÃ‚Â >Ã‚Â 0 and bÃ‚Â Ã¢Â‰Â¥Ã‚Â 0.
A Gaussian integer z1Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â a1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â b1i is said to be divisible by
z2Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â a2Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â b2i if z3Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â a3Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â b3iÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â z1/z2 is a Gaussian integer.
$\frac {z_1} {z_2} = \frac {a_1 + b_1 i} {a_2 + b_2 i} = \frac {(a_1 + b_1 i)
(a_2 - b_2 i)} {(a_2 + b_2 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} = \frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2
+ b_2^2} + \frac {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}i = a_3 + b_3 i$
So, z1 is divisible by z2 if $\frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ and
$\frac {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ are integers.
For example, 2 is divisible by 1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i because 2/(1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1Ã‚Â -Ã‚Â i is a
Gaussian integer.
A Gaussian prime is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a unit, itself
or itself times a unit.
For example, 1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 2i is a Gaussian prime, because it is only divisible by 1,
i, -1, -i, 1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 2i, i(1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 2i)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â iÃ‚Â -Ã‚Â 2, -(1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 2i)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -1Ã‚Â -Ã‚Â 2i and -i
(1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 2i)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 2Ã‚Â -Ã‚Â i.
2 is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by 1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i.
A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit and proper
Gaussian primes.
For example 2Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -i(1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i)2 and 1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 3iÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â (1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i)(2Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i).
A Gaussian integer is said to be squarefree if its prime factorization does not
contain repeated proper Gaussian primes.
So 2 is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but 1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 3i is.
Units and Gaussian primes are squarefree by definition.
Let f(n) be the count of proper squarefree Gaussian integers with
a2Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â b2Ã‚Â Ã¢Â‰Â¤Ã‚Â n.
For example f(10)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 7 because 1, 1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i, 1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 2i, 1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 3iÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â (1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i)
(2Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i), 2Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i, 3 and 3Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â iÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -i(1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i)(1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 2i) are squarefree,
while 2Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -i(1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i)2 and 2Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 2iÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -i(1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â i)3 are not.
You are given f(102)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 54, f(104)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 5218 and f(108)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 52126906.
Find f(1014).



***** Cutting triangles *****
**** Problem 557 ****
Published on Sunday, 24th April 2016, 10:00 am; Solved by 131
A triangle is cut into four pieces by two straight lines, each starting at one
vertex and ending on the opposite edge. This results in forming three smaller
triangular pieces, and one quadrilateral. If the original triangle has an
integral area, it is often possible to choose cuts such that all of the four
pieces also have integral area. For example, the diagram below shows a triangle
of area 55 that has been cut in this way.
                              [p557-triangle.gif]
Representing the areas as a, b, c and d, in the example above, the individual
areas are a = 22, b = 8, c = 11 and d = 14. It is also possible to cut a
triangle of area 55 such that a = 20, b = 2, c = 24, d = 9.
Define a triangle cutting quadruple (a, b, c, d) as a valid integral division
of a triangle, where a is the area of the triangle between the two cut
vertices, d is the area of the quadrilateral and b and c are the areas of the
two other triangles, with the restriction that b Ã¢Â‰Â¤ c. The two solutions
described above are (22,8,11,14) and (20,2,24,9). These are the only two
possible quadruples that have a total area of 55.
Define S(n) as the sum of the area of the uncut triangles represented by all
valid quadruples with a+b+c+d Ã¢Â‰Â¤ n.
For example, S(20) = 259.
Find S(10000).



***** Irrational base *****

Published on Saturday, 30th April 2016, 01:00 pm; Solved by 102
Let r be the real root of the equation x3Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â x2Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â 1.
Every positive integer can be written as the sum of distinct increasing powers
of r.
If we require the number of terms to be finite and the difference between any
two exponents to be three or more, then the representation is unique.
For example, 3Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â rÃ‚Â -10Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â rÃ‚Â -5Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â rÃ‚Â -1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â rÃ‚Â 2 and 10Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â rÃ‚Â -
10Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â rÃ‚Â -7Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â rÃ‚Â 6.
Interestingly, the relation holds for the complex roots of the equation.
Let w(n) be the number of terms in this unique representation of n. Thus w
(3)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4 and w(10)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.
More formally, for all positive integers n, we have:
n = $\displaystyle \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}$ bkÃ‚Â rk
under the conditions that:
bk is 0 or 1 for all k;
bkÃ‚Â +Ã‚Â bk+1Ã‚Â +Ã‚Â bk+2Ã‚Â Ã¢Â‰Â¤Ã‚Â 1 for all k;
w(n) = $\displaystyle \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}$ bk is finite.
Let S(m)Ã‚Â = $\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{m}$ w(j2).
You are given S(10) = 61 and S(1000) = 19403.
Find S(5 000 000).



***** Permuted Matrices *****
**** Problem 559 ****
Published on Saturday, 7th May 2016, 04:00 pm; Solved by 62
An ascent of a column j in a matrix occurs if the value of column j is smaller
than the value of column j+1 in all rows.
Let P(k, r, n) be the number of r x n matrices with the following properties:
    * The rows are permutations of {1, 2, 3, ... , n}.
    * Numbering the first column as 1, a column ascent occurs at column j<n if
      and only if j is not a multiple of k.
For example, P(1, 2, 3) = 19, P(2, 4, 6) = 65508751 and P(7, 5, 30) mod
1000000123 = 161858102.
Let Q(n) =$\, \displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n\,$ P(k, n, n).
For example, Q(5) = 21879393751 and Q(50) mod 1000000123 = 819573537.

Let L(n,Ã‚Â k) be the number of losing starting positions for the first player,
assuming perfect play, when the game is played with k piles, each having
